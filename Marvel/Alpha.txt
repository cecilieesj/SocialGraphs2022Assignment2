In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it has a value of one. Alpha is derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[Aleph#Origin|aleph]] [[Image:phoenician aleph.svg|20px|aleph]], which is the [[West Semitic]] word for "[[ox]]".<ref>{{cite book | last=Brookes | first=I. | title=Chamber Concise Dictionary | publisher=Allied Pub (p) Limited | year=2004 | isbn=978-81-86062-36-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwWuY9tAVq8C | page=30 | access-date=15 November 2021 | archive-date=11 June 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220611085621/https://books.google.com/books?id=iwWuY9tAVq8C | url-status=live }}</ref> Letters that arose from alpha include the [[Latin script|Latin]] letter [[A]] and the [[Cyrillic]] letter [[A (Cyrillic)|А]].\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Greek===\nIn [[Ancient Greek]], alpha was pronounced {{IPAblink|ä|a}} and could be either [[phoneme|phonemically]] long ([aː]) or short ([a]). Where there is ambiguity, long and short alpha are sometimes written with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] and [[breve]] today: Ᾱᾱ, Ᾰᾰ.\n*[[wikt:ὥρα#Ancient Greek|ὥρα]] = ὥρᾱ \'\'hōrā\'\' {{IPA-el|hɔ́ːraː}} "a time"\n*[[wikt:γλῶσσα#Ancient Greek|γλῶσσα]] = γλῶσσᾰ \'\'glôssa\'\' {{IPA-el|ɡlɔ̂ːssa}} "tongue"\n\nIn [[Modern Greek]], [[vowel length]] has been lost, and all instances of alpha simply represent the [[open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA-el|a|IPA}}.\n\nIn the [[polytonic Greek|polytonic]] orthography of Greek, alpha, like other vowel letters, can occur with several diacritic marks: any of three accent symbols ({{lang|grc|ά, ὰ, ᾶ}}), and either of two breathing marks ({{lang|grc|ἁ, ἀ}}), as well as combinations of these. It can also combine with the [[iota subscript]] ({{lang|grc|ᾳ}}).\n\n====Greek grammar====\nIn the [[Attic Greek|Attic]]–[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialect of Ancient Greek, long alpha {{IPA|[aː]}} fronted to {{IPAblink|ɛː}} ([[eta]]). In Ionic, the shift took place in all positions. In Attic, the shift did not take place after [[epsilon]], [[iota]], and [[rho]] (ε, ι, ρ; \'\'e\'\', \'\'i\'\', \'\'r\'\'). In [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], long alpha is preserved in all positions.<ref>[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. \'\'Greek grammar for colleges\'\'.

In [[ethology]], it is used to name the [[Alpha (ethology)|dominant individual]] in a group of animals. In aerodynamics, the letter is used as a symbol for the [[angle of attack]] of an aircraft and the word "alpha" is used as a synonym for this property. In [[mathematical logic]], α is sometimes used as a placeholder for [[ordinal number]]s.\n\nThe proportionality operator "[[∝]]" (in [[Unicode]]: U+221D) is sometimes mistaken for alpha.\n\nThe uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase [[A|Latin A]].\n\n===International Phonetic Alphabet===\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], the letter ɑ, which looks similar to the lower-case alpha, represents the [[open back unrounded vowel]].\n\n==History and symbolism==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2021}}\n{{see|History of the Greek alphabet}}\n\n===Origin===\nThe [[Phoenician alphabet]] was adopted for Greek in the early 8th century BC, perhaps in [[Euboea]].<ref>The date of the earliest inscribed objects; A.W. Johnston, "The alphabet", in N. Stampolidis and V.

Ammonius asks Plutarch what he, being a [[Boeotia]]n, has to say for [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenicia]]n who reputedly settled in [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, placing \'\'alpha\'\' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]]—which, unlike [[Hesiod]],<ref>Hesiod, in \'\'[[Works and Days]]\'\' (see on [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0132:card=405 Perseus Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117133713/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D405 |date=17 January 2021 }}), advises the early Greek farmers, "First of all, get a house, then a woman and third, an ox for the plough."</ref> the Phoenicians considered not the second or third, but the first of all necessities. "Nothing at all," Plutarch replied. He then added that he would rather be assisted by [[Lamprias]], his own grandfather, than by [[Dionysus]]\' grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. For Lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is "alpha", because it is very plain and simple—the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue—and therefore this is the first sound that children make.\n\nAccording to Plutarch\'s natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]].\n\n===Alpha and Omega===\n[[Image:Memorial Stained Glass, Yeo Hall, Chapel, Royal Military College of Canada 605 Oliver Tiffany & 203 Williiam Bermingham.jpg|right|thumb|Memorial Stained Glass window, [[Royal Military College of Canada]] features Alpha and Omega]]\n{{main|Alpha and Omega}}\n\nAs the first letter of the alphabet, Alpha as a [[Greek numeral]] came to represent the number [[1 (number)|1]].\nTherefore, Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to the "first", or "primary", or "principal" (most significant) occurrence or status of a thing.\n \nThe New Testament has God declaring himself to be the "Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."
