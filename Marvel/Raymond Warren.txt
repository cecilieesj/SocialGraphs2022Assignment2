Later he studied privately with [[Michael Tippett]] (1952–60), [[Lennox Berkeley]] (1958) and [[Benjamin Britten]] (1961). From 1955 to 1972 he taught at [[Queen\'s University, Belfast]], where from 1966 he held a personal Chair in composition.

The first of these was with his contemporary [[Seamus Heaney]], \'\'A Lough Neagh Sequence\'\' (1970).  Warren wrote:\n{{Blockquote\n|"I knew Seamus Heaney quite well – we were both young lecturers at the Queen’s University of Belfast – and I thought of him then, before his coming to international fame, as essentially a deep-rooted Irish country poet. He didn’t want his poetry to lose its own “music” by being sung, and I was happy with this because, as an outsider to his tradition I felt I could not readily penetrate it with my music so closely. Hence the decision not to set his sequence as song but instead to have the poems read and to bring out their almost ritualistic long term structures with the use of overlaid piano interludes."\n}}\nHeaney made a recording of this version of his poetry with Warren\'s music in 2011.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nFeXbXjjePShWhjSN3kFn60RrPS5EY-Ro \'\'The Next Ocean\'\', UH Recordings (2011)]</ref><ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2012/May12/Warren_UH020011023.htm \'\'The Next Ocean\'\', reviewed at MusicWeb International]</ref>\n\nMany of his shorter works are among his most powerful including the solo cantata for flute, piano and mezzo soprano, \'\'Drop, Drop Slow Tears\'\' (1960) and the \'\'Song for St. Cecilia’s Day\'\' (1967) scored for tenor, flute, viola, guitar and first performed by [[Peter Pears]], [[Richard Adeney]], [[Cecil Aronowitz]] and [[Julian Bream]]. His best selling work as a recording is the orchestral suite \'\'Wexford Bells\'\' (1970).<ref>\'\'British Light Music Discoveries 2\'\', Royal Ballet Sinfonia, Gavin Sutherland, White Line CD
