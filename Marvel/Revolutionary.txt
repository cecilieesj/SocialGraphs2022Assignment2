In politics, a revolutionary is someone who supports abrupt, rapid, and drastic change, usually replacing the status quo, while a [[Reformism|reformist]] is someone who supports more gradual and incremental change, often working within the system. In that sense, revolutionaries may be considered radical, while reformists are moderate by comparison. Moments which seem revolutionary on the surface may end up reinforcing established institutions. Likewise, evidently small changes may lead to revolutionary consequences in the long term. Thus the clarity of the distinction between revolution and reform is more conceptual than empirical.\n\nA [[Conservatism|conservative]] is someone who generally opposes such changes. A [[reactionary]] is someone who wants things to go back to the way they were before the change has happened (and when this return to the past would represent a major change in and of itself, reactionaries can simultaneously be revolutionaries). A revolution is also not the same as a [[Coup d\'état|coup d\'etat]]: while a coup usually involves a small group of conspirators violently seizing control of government, a revolution implies mass participation and popular legitimacy. Again, the distinction is often clearer conceptually than empirically.\n\n==Revolution and ideology==\nAccording to sociologist [[James Chowning Davies]], political revolutionaries may be classified in two ways:\n#According to the \'\'goals\'\' of the revolution they propose. Usually, these goals are part of a certain [[ideology]]. In theory, each ideology could generate its own brand of revolutionaries. In practice, most political revolutionaries have been [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [[Communism|communists]], [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Islamism|Islamists]], [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]], or [[Nationalism|nationalists]].\n#According to the \'\'methods\'\' they propose to use. This divides revolutionaries in two broad groups: Those who advocate a violent revolution, and those who are [[Pacifism|pacifists]].\n\n===Anarchism===\n{{see also|Anarchism}}\nThe revolutionary [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Sergey Nechayev]] argued in \'\'[[Catechism of a Revolutionary]]\'\': <blockquote>"The revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no private interests, no affairs, sentiments, ties, property nor even a name of his own. His entire being is devoured by one purpose, one thought, one passion - the revolution. Heart and soul, not merely by word but by deed, he has severed every link with the social order and with the entire civilized world; with the laws, good manners, conventions, and morality of that world. He is its merciless enemy and continues to inhabit it with only one purpose - to destroy it."<ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSnechayev.htm Nechayev] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018034125/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSnechayev.htm|date=2008-10-18}}, Spartacus Educational website by John Simkin</ref><ref>[[Sergey Nechayev]] (1869).
