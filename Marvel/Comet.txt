This produces a visible atmosphere or [[Coma (cometary)|coma]], and sometimes also a [[Comet tail|tail]]. These phenomena are due to the effects of [[solar radiation]] and the [[solar wind]] acting upon the nucleus of the comet. [[Comet nuclei]] range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times Earth\'s diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one [[astronomical unit]]. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may [[Subtended angle|subtend]] an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions.\n\nComets usually have highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of [[orbital period]]s, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. [[#Short period|Short-period comet]]s originate in the [[Kuiper belt]] or its associated [[scattered disc]], which lie beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]]. [[#Long period|Long-period comet]]s are thought to originate in the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe |publisher=Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |first=Lisa |last=Randall |pages=104–105 |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-06-232847-2}}</ref> Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by [[gravitational perturbation]]s caused by [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passing stars]] and the [[galactic tide]]. [[Hyperbolic comet]]s may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.\n\nComets are distinguished from [[asteroid]]s by the presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun\'s light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, [[extinct comets]] that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the difference between asteroids and comets |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Frequently_asked_questions |work=Rosetta\'s Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=European Space Agency |access-date=30 July 2013}}</ref> Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Are Asteroids And Comets |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040628110338/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 June 2004 |work=Near Earth Object Program FAQ |publisher=NASA |access-date=30 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Comparison of Comet 81P/Wild 2 Dust with Interplanetary Dust from Comets |last1=Ishii |first1=H.
