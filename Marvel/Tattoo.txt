[[Tattoo artist|Tattoo artists]] create these designs using several [[Process of tattooing|tattooing processes and techniques]], including hand-tapped traditional tattoos and modern [[Tattoo machine|tattoo machines]]. The [[history of tattooing]] goes back to [[Neolithic]] times, practiced across the globe by many cultures, and the symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures.\n\nTattoos may be decorative (with no specific meaning), symbolic (with a specific meaning to the wearer), or pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). Many tattoos serve as [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], marks of status and rank, symbols of religious and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, marks of [[fertility]], pledges of love, [[amulet]]s and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts.

After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a [[Homogenization (biology)|homogenized]] damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the [[immune system]]\'s [[phagocyte]]s to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin [[granulation tissue]] forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by [[collagen]] growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within successive generations of [[macrophage]]s, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.<ref name=kilmer>{{cite web|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1121212-overview|title=Tattoo Lasers: Overview, Histology, Tattoo Removal Techniques|date=13 September 2017 |publisher=[[Medscape]]}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Tattoo machine 2 coil.jpg|thumb|upright|A two coil tattoo machine]]\nSome tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to [[scarification]]. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made into needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, actual needles.\n\nThe most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric [[tattoo machine]], which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are [[solder]]ed onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually, or manufactured by artists, on-demand, as groupings dictate on a per-piece basis.\n\nIn modern tattooing, an artist may use thermal stencil paper or [[hectograph]] ink/stencil paper to first place a printed design on the skin before applying a tattoo design.\n\n==Practice regulation and health risk certification==\nTattooing is regulated in many countries because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattooist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified [[autoclave]] before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.<ref name="CIEH2013">{{cite web|title=Tattooing and body piercing guidance: Toolkit|url=https://www.cieh.org/media/1261/tattooing-and-body-piercing-guidance-toolkit-july-2013.pdf|publisher=Chartered Institute of Environmental Health|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Associations==\n\n===Historical associations===\n{{see also|Religious perspectives on tattooing}}\n[[File:Body art, 1907 black n white.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maud Wagner|Mrs. M.

Modern tattooists reduce health risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne pathogen]] training such as that provided through the [[Red Cross]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]].

They may last for a day or for more than a week.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm108569.htm | title=Temporary Tattoos, Henna/Mehndi, and "Black Henna" | work=FDA | access-date=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Metallic jewelry tattoos====\nFoil temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using a foil stamping technique instead of using ink.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Baldwin |first=Pepper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4uaCwAAQBAJ&dq=foil+temporary+tattoo&pg=PA28 |title=DIY Temporary Tattoos: Draw It, Print It, Ink It |date=2016-04-05 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-1-250-08770-6 |pages=28 |language=en}}</ref> The foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\n====Airbrush temporary tattoos====\nAlthough they have become more popular and usually require a greater investment, airbrush temporary tattoos are less likely to achieve the look of a permanent tattoo, and may not last as long as press-on temporary tattoos. An artist sprays on airbrush tattoos using a stencil with alcohol-based cosmetic inks. Like decal tattoos, airbrush temporary tattoos also are easily removed with rubbing alcohol or [[baby oil]].\n\n====Henna temporary tattoos====\n[[File:Lower leg Tattoo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[henna]] temporary tattoo being applied]]\nAnother tattoo alternative is [[henna]]-based tattoos, which generally contain no additives. Henna is a plant-derived substance which is painted on the skin, staining it a reddish-orange-to-brown color. Because of the semi-permanent nature of henna, they lack the realistic colors typical of decal temporary tattoos. Due to the time-consuming application process, it is a relatively poor option for children. Dermatological publications report that allergic reactions to natural henna are very rare and the product is generally considered safe for skin application. Serious problems can occur, however, from the use of henna with certain additives. The FDA and medical journals report that painted black henna temporary tattoos are especially dangerous.\n\n===Safety===\n\n====Decal-style temporary tattoo safety====\nDecal temporary tattoos, when legally sold in the United States, have had their color additives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as cosmetics – the FDA has determined these colorants are safe for "direct dermal contact". While the FDA has received some accounts of minor skin irritation, including redness and swelling, from this type of temporary tattoo, the agency has found these symptoms to be "child specific" and not significant enough to support warnings to the public. Unapproved pigments, however, which are sometimes used by non-US manufacturers, can provoke allergic reactions in anyone.\n\n====Airbrush tattoo safety====\nThe types of airbrush paints manufactured for crafting, creating art or decorating clothing should never be used for tattooing. These paints can be allergenic or toxic.\n\n====Henna tattoo safety====\n[[Image:Dermititis black henna.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Dermatitis]] due to a temporary tattoo (dolphin) made with [[black henna]]]]\nThe [[FDA]] regularly issues warnings to consumers about avoiding any temporary tattoos labeled as black henna or pre-mixed henna as these may contain potentially harmful ingredients including [[silver nitrate]], [[carmine]], [[pyrogallol]], [[disperse orange dye]] and [[chromium]]. Black henna gets its color from [[paraphenylenediamine]] (PPD), a [[textile dye]] approved by the FDA for human use only in hair coloring.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/03/26/fda-warns-consumers-about-dangers-temporary-tattoos/ | title=FDA warns consumers about dangers of temporary tattoos | work=Fox News | date=26 March 2013 | access-date=3 August 2015}}</ref> In Canada, the use of PPD on the skin, including hair dye, is banned. Research has linked these and other ingredients to a range of health problems including allergic reactions, chronic inflammatory reactions, and late-onset allergic reactions to related clothing and hairdressing dyes. They can cause these reactions long after application. Neither black henna nor pre-mixed henna are approved for cosmetic use by the FDA.\n\n==Religious views==\n{{Main|Religious perspectives on tattooing}}\n[[File:Jesus is So Cool.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Christianity|Christian]] couple with matching cross symbol tattoos to associate with their faith]]\n[[Egyptians]] originally used tattoos to show dedication to a god, and the tattoos were believed to convey divine protection.

Jews tend to believe this commandment only applies to Jews and not to [[gentiles]].

Most [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations believe that the [[Old Covenant]] ceremonial laws in Leviticus were [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogated]] with the coming of the [[New Covenant]]; that the prohibition of various cultural practices, including tattooing, was intended to distinguish the [[Israelites]] from neighbouring peoples for a limited period of time, and was not intended as a universal law to apply to the gentiles for all time.
