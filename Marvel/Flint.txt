A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour, typically white and rough in texture. The nodules can often be found along [[stream]]s and [[beach]]es.\n\nFlint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces, making it useful for knife blades and other cutting tools. The use of flint to make [[stone tools]] dates back hundreds of thousands of years, and flint\'s extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time. Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the [[Stone Age]].\n\nDuring the Stone Age, access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade to obtain flint. [[Flint Ridge State Memorial|Flint Ridge]] in [[Ohio]] was an important source of flint and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge. This "Ohio Flint" was traded across the eastern United States and has been found as far west as the [[Rocky Mountains]] and south around the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://geology.com/rocks/flint.shtml|title=Uses of Flint - Tools, weapons, fire starters, gemstones|website=geology.com|access-date=26 March 2019|archive-date=27 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127012303/https://geology.com/rocks/flint.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen struck against steel, flint will produce enough sparks to ignite a fire with the correct [[tinder]], or [[gunpowder]] used [[History of gunpowder|in weapons]], namely the [[flintlock]] [[Flintlock mechanism|firing mechanism]]. Although it has been superseded in these uses by different processes (the [[percussion cap]]), or materials ([[ferrocerium]]), "flint" has lent its name as generic term for a fire starter.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Silica pseudomorph after halite crystals and silicified remains of algae 6.jpg|thumb|Silicified remains of algae and silica pseudomorph after halite in flint. Pebble of Loire near Marcigny, France. Image width: about 5 mm.]]\n\nThe exact mode of formation of flint is not yet clear, but it is thought that it occurs as a result of chemical changes in compressed sedimentary rock formations during the process of [[diagenesis]]. One [[hypothesis]] is that a gelatinous material fills cavities in the sediment, such as holes bored by [[crustaceans]] or [[molluscs]] and that this becomes [[silicification|silicified]]. This hypothesis certainly explains the complex shapes of flint nodules that are found. The source of dissolved silica in the porous media could be the [[spicules of silicious sponges]] ([[demosponge]]s).<ref name=Flints/> Certain types of flint, such as that from the south coast of England and its counterpart on the French side of the [[English Channel|Channel]], contain trapped fossilised marine flora. Pieces of coral and vegetation have been found preserved inside the flint similar to insects and plant parts within [[amber]]. Thin slices of the stone often reveal this effect.\n\n[[File:flintbeach.jpg|thumb|upright|Pebble beach made up of flint nodules eroded from the nearby [[chalk]] cliffs, [[Cape Arkona]], [[Rügen]], northeast Germany.]]\nFlint sometimes occurs in large [[flint fields]] in [[Jurassic]] or [[Cretaceous]] beds, for example, in Europe. Puzzling giant flint formations known as [[paramoudra]] and flint circles are found around Europe but especially in Norfolk, England on the beaches at [[Beeston Regis#Beeston Hill (Beeston Bump)|Beeston Bump]] and [[West Runton]].<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/default.asp?Document=400.500.100.030x2 Museums.norfolk.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012025938/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/default.asp?Document=400.500.100.030x2 |date=12 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe "Ohio flint" is the official gemstone of Ohio state. It is formed from limey debris that was deposited at the bottom of inland [[Paleozoic]] seas hundreds of millions of years ago that hardened into [[limestone]] and later became infused with [[silica]].

Holmes Ellis began to study the knapping methods and techniques of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Like past studies, this work involved experimenting with actual knapping techniques by creation of stone tools through the use of techniques like direct freehand percussion, freehand pressure and pressure using a rest. Other scholars who have conducted similar experiments and studies include [[William Henry Holmes]], [[Alonzo W. Pond]], [[Sir Francis Knowles, 5th Baronet|Francis H. S.

A piece of flint held in the jaws of a spring-loaded hammer, when released by a trigger, strikes a [[hinged]] piece of steel ("[[frizzen]]") at an angle, creating a shower of sparks and exposing a charge of priming powder. The sparks ignite the priming powder and that flame, in turn, ignites the main charge, propelling the ball, bullet, or shot through the barrel. While the military use of the flintlock declined after the adoption of the [[percussion cap]] from the 1840s onward, flintlock rifles and shotguns remain in use amongst recreational shooters.\n\n====Comparison with ferrocerium====\n\nFlint and steel used to strike sparks were superseded in the 20th century by [[ferrocerium]] (sometimes referred to as "flint", although not true flint, "[[mischmetal]]", "hot spark", "metal match", or "fire steel"). This man-made material, when scraped with any hard, sharp edge, produces sparks that are much hotter than obtained with natural flint and steel, allowing use of a wider range of tinders. Because it can produce sparks when wet and can start fires when used correctly, ferrocerium is commonly included in [[survival kit]]s. Ferrocerium is used in many cigarette lighters, where it is referred to as "a flint".\n\n====Fragmentation====\n\nFlint\'s utility as a fire starter is hampered by its property of uneven expansion under heating, causing it to fracture, sometimes violently, during heating. This tendency is enhanced by the impurities found in most samples of flint that may expand to a greater or lesser degree than the surrounding stone, and is similar to the tendency of [[Thermal fracturing in glass|glass to shatter]] when exposed to heat, and can become a drawback when flint is used as a [[building material]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/scoutnotebook/fires/cooking.html |title=Building a cooking fire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525115954/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/scoutnotebook/fires/cooking.html |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |work=Scout Notebook |access-date=January 30, 2018 |year=2001}}</ref>\n\n===As a building material===\n\nFlint, knapped or unknapped, has been used from antiquity (for example at the Late Roman fort of [[Burgh Castle Roman Site|Burgh Castle]] in Norfolk) up to the present day as a material for building stone walls, using lime mortar, and often combined with other available stone or brick rubble. It was most common in those parts of southern England where no good building stone was available locally, and where brick-making was not widespread until the later Middle Ages. It is especially associated with [[East Anglia]], but also used in chalky areas stretching through [[Hampshire]], Sussex, [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] to [[Somerset]].\n\nFlint was used in the construction of many churches, houses, and other buildings, for example, the large stronghold of [[Framlingham Castle]]. Many different decorative effects have been achieved by using different types of knapping or arrangement and combinations with stone ([[flushwork]]), especially in the 15th and early 16th centuries. Because knapping flints to a relatively flush surface and size is a highly skilled process with a high level of wastage, flint finishes typically indicate high status buildings.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:flint church in england arp.jpg|A flint church – the Parish Church of Saint Thomas, in [[Cricket Saint Thomas]], Somerset, England.
