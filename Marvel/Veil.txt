Veiling has a long history in European, Asian, and African societies. The practice has been prominent in different forms in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. The practice of veiling is especially associated with women and sacred objects, though in some cultures, it is men, rather than women, who are expected to wear a veil. Besides its enduring religious significance, veiling continues to play a role in some modern secular contexts, such as wedding customs.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word [[wikt:veil|\'\'veil\'\']] ultimately originates from [[Latin]] \'\'[[wikt:velum#Latin|vƒìlum]]\'\', which also means "[[sail]]," from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] \'\'*weg ∞slom\'\', from the verbal root \'\'*weg ∞-\'\' "to drive, to move or ride in a vehicle" (compare \'\'way\'\' and \'\'[[wikt:wain|wain]]\'\') and the tool/instrument suffix \'\'*-slo-\'\', because the sail makes the ship move. Compare the [[diminutive]] form \'\'[[wikt:vexillum|vexillum]]\'\', and the Slavic cognate \'\'[[wikt:veslo|veslo]]\'\' "oar, paddle", attested in Czech and Serbo-Croatian.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bronze_Statuette_of_a_Veiled_and_Masked_Dancer_1.jpg|thumb|upright|Greek bronze statuette of a veiled and masked dancer, 2nd‚Äì3rd century BC.]]\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nElite women in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and in the [[Rise of Macedon|Greek]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian empires]] wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status.<ref name="Ahmed 1992 15">{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=15}}</ref> The earliest attested reference to veiling is found a [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Middle Assyrian]] law code dating from between 1400 and 1100 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last= Graeber |first= David |author-link= David Graeber |year= 2011 |title= Debt: The First 5000 Years |place= Brooklyn, NY |publisher= Melville House |isbn= 9781933633862 |lccn= 2012462122 |page= [https://archive.org/details/debtfirst5000yea00grae/page/184 184] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/debtfirst5000yea00grae/page/184 }}</ref> Assyria had explicit [[sumptuary laws]] detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman\'s class, rank, and occupation in society.<ref name="Ahmed 1992 15"/> Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so.<ref name="El Guindi">{{Cite book|last=El Guindi|first=Fadwa|title=Hijab|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|author2=Sherifa Zahur|year= 2009|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001|isbn=9780195305135}}</ref> The Middle Assyrian law code states:<blockquote>¬ß\u202f40.

Caroline Galt and Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones have both argued from such representations and literary references that it was commonplace for women (at least those of higher status) in ancient Greece to cover their hair and face in public. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] women were expected to wear veils as a symbol of the husband\'s authority over his wife; a married woman who omitted the veil was seen as withdrawing herself from marriage. In 166 BC, consul [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus|Sulpicius Gallus]] divorced his wife because she had left the house unveiled, thus allowing all to see, as he said, what only he should see.

Only in the [[Tudor period]] (1485), when [[hood (headgear)|hood]]s became increasingly popular, did veils of this type become less common. This varied greatly from one country to another. In Italy, veils, including face veils, were worn in some regions until the 1970s.<ref>\'\'Doni, Elena & Manuela Fulgenz, Il secolo delle donne.

Sometimes a veil of this type was draped over and pinned to the [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] or hat of a woman in [[mourning]], especially at the [[funeral]] and during the subsequent period of "high mourning". They would also have been used, as an alternative to a [[mask]], as a simple method of hiding the identity of a woman who was traveling to meet a lover, or doing anything she didn\'t want other people to find out about. More pragmatically, veils were also sometimes worn to protect the complexion from sun and wind damage (when untanned skin was fashionable), or to keep dust out of a woman\'s face, much as the [[keffiyeh]] (worn by men) is used today.\n\n[[File:A_Coptic_woman_of_the_Poorer_Class._(1918)_-_TIMEA.jpg|thumb|[[Copts|Coptic]] Christian woman wearing a veil (1918)]]\n\nIn [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] the concept of covering the head is or was associated with propriety and modesty. Most traditional depictions of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], the mother of [[Christ]], show her veiled. During the [[Middle Ages]] most European married women covered their hair rather than their face, with a variety of styles of [[wimple]], kerchiefs and headscarves. Veiling, covering the hair, rather than the face, is a common practice among church-going women. While in the Western world this practice largely lapsed in the 1960s with the rise of the [[sexual revolution]], traditional congregations, such as those of [[Conservative Anabaptists]] and [[Traditional Catholic]]s, continue observing the [[ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]] of headcovering.<ref name="Anderson2019"/><ref name="Gordon2015"/><ref name="DBC2021">{{cite book |title=Dunkard Brethren Church Polity |date=1 November 2021 |publisher=[[Dunkard Brethren Church]] |page=6}}</ref><ref name="SJEOC2019"/> Lace face-veils are often worn by female relatives at funerals in some Catholic countries. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], married women cover their hair for reasons of modesty; many Orthodox Jewish women wear headscarves ([[tichel]]) for this purpose.\n\nChristian Byzantine literature expressed rigid norms pertaining to veiling of women, which have been influenced by Persian traditions, although there is evidence to suggest that they differed significantly from actual practice.<ref name=ahmed26 /> Since Islam identified with the monotheistic religions practiced in the Byzantine and [[Sassanian]] empires, in the aftermath of the [[early Muslim conquests]] veiling of women was adopted as an appropriate expression of Qur\'anic ideals regarding modesty and piety.<ref>Ahmed 1992, p. 36.</ref> Veiling gradually spread to upper-class Arab women, and eventually, it became widespread among Muslim women in cities throughout the Middle East.

In medieval times married women normally covered their hair outside the house, and a nun\'s veil is based on secular medieval styles, often reflecting the fashion of widows in their attire.  {{anchor|Probation}}<!--[[veil of probation]] redirects here-->{{anchor|Profession}}<!--[[veil of profession]] redirects here-->{{anchor|Consecration}}<!--[[veil of consecration]] redirects here-->In many institutes, a white veil is used as the "veil of probation" during [[novitiate]], and a dark veil for the "veil of profession" once religious vows are taken; the color scheme varies with the color scheme of the habit of the order.\n\nA veil of [[consecration]], longer and fuller, is used by some orders whose nuns receive the consecration of virgins who are already in [[solemn vow]]s or who are being consecrated as a virgin in the same ceremony. References to "consecrated nuns" in medieval literature refers to solemnly professed nuns who received the solemn consecration of virgins from their bishops, usually some years after their final profession of vows. Nuns who receive the consecration of virgins may or may not be distinguished from other nuns depending on the customs of their order.\n\nAfter the promulgation of Pope Paul\'s VI. decree \'\'[[Perfectae caritatis]]\'\' on the adaption and renewal of religious life<ref>No. 17, "The religious habit, an outward mark of consecration to God, should be simple and modest, poor and at the same becoming. In addition it must meet the requirements of health and be suited to the circumstances of time and place and to the needs of the ministry involved. The habits of both men and women religious which do not conform to these norms must be changed."</ref> most [[monasticism|monastic orders]] for [[nun]]s retained the veil. Regarding other institutes of religious sisters who are not [[cloister]]ed but who work as teachers, nurses or in other active apostolates outside of a nunnery or monastery, some wear the veil, while some others have abolished the use of the veil.\n\nThe fullest versions of the nun\'s veil cover the top of the head and flow down around and over the shoulders. In western Christianity, it does not wrap around the neck or face. In those orders that retain one, the starched white covering about the face, neck, and shoulders is known as a [[wimple]] and is a separate garment.\n\nThe Catholic Church has revived the ancient practice of women to be consecrated by their bishop as a [[consecrated virgin]] living in the world. These virgins are set aside as sacred persons who belong only to Christ and the service of the church. The veil is a bridal one, because the velatio virginum primarily signified the newly consecrated virgin as the [[Bride of Christ]]. In ancient times his veil was called the \'\'flammeum\'\' because it was supposed to remind the virgin of the indissoluble nuptial bond she was contracting with Christ. The wearing of the \'\'flammeum\'\' for the sacred virgin Bride of Christ arose from the bridal attire of the strictest pagan marriage which did not permit of divorce at the time. The flammeum was a visible reminder that divorce was not possible with Christ, their Divine Spouse.\n\nSome [[Lutheran]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] women\'s religious orders also wear a veil, differing according to the traditions of each order.\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rites]] of the Catholic Church, a veil called an \'\'[[epanokamelavkion]]\'\' is used by both nuns and monks, in both cases covering completely the \'\'[[kamilavka|kamilavkion]]\'\', a cylindrical hat they both wear. In [[Church Slavonic language|Slavic]] practice, when the veil is worn over the hat, the entire [[headgear|headdress]] is referred to as a \'\'[[klobuk]]\'\'. Nuns wear an additional veil under the \'\'klobuk\'\', called an \'\'[[apostolnik]]\'\', which is drawn together to cover the neck and shoulders as well as the head, leaving the face itself open.\n\n==== Veiling of objects ====\n<!-- [[Chalice veil]] redirects here -->\n{{See also|Altar cloth}}\n[[File:Aer on a Chalice and Discos.jpg|thumb|250px|[[A√´r]] covering a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] and [[Paten|diskos]] on the [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]]]\n[[File:Autel.matutinal.abbaye.Saint.Denis.png|thumb|200px|Sanctuary in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]] showing veiling to either side of the altar<ref>\'\'Dictionary of French Architecture from 11th to 16th century\'\' [1856] by Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc</ref>]]\n[[File:StMartin43-53.JPG|thumb|200px|An altar cross veiled during [[Holy Week]]]]\n[[File:Welon, bursa i stu≈Ça.jpg|thumb|200px|Western burse and chalice veil laid over the holy vessels. There is also a [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]] sitting to the right of the chalice.]]\n\nAmong [[Christian Church|Christian churches]] which have a [[liturgy|liturgical]] tradition, several different types of veils are used. These veils are often symbolically tied to the veils in the [[Tabernacle]] in the wilderness and in [[Solomon\'s Temple]]. The purpose of these veils was not so much to obscure as to shield the most sacred things from the eyes of sinful men. In [[Solomon\'s Temple]] the veil was placed between the "Inner Sanctuary" and the "[[Holy of Holies]]". According to the New Testament, this veil was torn when [[Jesus Christ]] died on the cross.\n\n*Tabernacle veil\n: Used to cover the [[church tabernacle]], particularly in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition but in some others as well, when the [[Eucharist]] is actually stored in it.<ref name=":14" /> The veil is used to remind worshipers that the (usually metal) tabernacle cabinet echoes the tabernacle tent of the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]], and it signals that the tabernacle is actually in use.<ref name=":14" /> It may be of any liturgical color, but is most often white (always appropriate for the Eucharist), [[cloth of gold]] or silver (which may substitute for any liturgical color aside from violet), or the liturgical color of the day (red, green or violet). It may be simple, unadorned linen or silk, or it may be fringed or otherwise decorated. It is often designed to match the [[vestment]]s of the [[Priest|celebrant]]s.\n\n*Ciborium veil\n: The [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]] is a goblet-like metal vessel with a cover, used in the Roman Catholic Church and some others to hold the consecrated [[Sacramental bread|hosts]] of the Eucharist when, for instance, it is stored in the tabernacle or when [[Eucharist|communion]] is to be distributed. It may be veiled with a white cloth, usually silk. This veiling was formerly required but is now optional. In part, it signals that the ciborium actually contains the [[Consecration|consecrated]] Eucharist at the moment.\n\n*Chalice veil\n: During Eucharistic celebrations, a veil is often used to cover the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] and [[paten]] to keep dust and flying insects away from the bread and wine. Often made of rich material, the chalice veils have not only a practical purpose, but are also intended to show honor to vessels used for the [[sacrament]].\n:In the West, a single chalice veil is normally used. The veil will usually be the same material and color as the priest\'s vestments, though it may also be white. It covers the chalice and paten when not actually in use on the altar.\n:In the East, three veils are used: one for the chalice, one for the [[Paten|diskos]] (paten), and a third one (the [[A√´r]]) is used to cover both. The veils for the chalice and diskos are usually square with four [[lappet]]s hanging down the sides, so that when the veil is laid out flat it will be shaped like a cross. The A√´r is rectangular and usually larger than the chalice veil used in the West. The A√´r also figures prominently in other liturgical respects.\n\n*Humeral veil\n: The [[humeral veil]] is used in both Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches during the liturgy of Exposition and [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]], and on some other occasions when special respect is shown to the Eucharist. From the [[Latin]] for "shoulders," it is an oblong piece of cloth worn as a sort of [[shawl]], used to symbolize a more profound awareness of the respect due to the Eucharist by shielding the celebrant\'s hands from actually contacting the vessel holding the Eucharist, either a [[monstrance]] or [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], or in some cases to shield the vessel itself from the eyes of participants. It is worn only by [[bishop]]s, [[priest]]s or [[deacon]]s.\n\n*Vimpa\n:A [[vimpa]] is a veil or shawl worn over the shoulders of servers who carry the [[mitre|miter]] and [[crosier]] in Roman Catholic liturgical functions when they are not being used by the bishop.\n\n*Chancel veil\n:In the early liturgies, there was often a veil that separated the sanctuary from the rest of the church (again, based upon the biblical description of the Tabernacle). In the Byzantine liturgy this veil developed into the [[iconostasis]], but a veil or curtain is still used behind the [[Royal Doors]] (the main doors leading into the sanctuary), and is opened and closed at specific times during the liturgy. In the West, it developed into the Rood Veil, and later the [[Rood screen|Rood Screen]], and finally the [[chancel]] rail, the low sanctuary railing in those churches that still have this. In some of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]] (for instance, the [[East Syrian Rite|Syrian liturgy]]) the use of a veil across the entire sanctuary has been retained.\n\n*Lenten veiling\n: Some churches veil their crosses during [[Passiontide]] with a fine semi-transparent mesh. The color of the veil may be black, red, purple, or white, depending upon the liturgical day and practice of the church. In traditional churches, there will sometimes be curtains placed to either side of the altar.\n\nThe \'\'\'[[The Protection of the Mother of God|Veil of our Lady]]\'\'\' is a liturgical feast celebrating the protection afforded by the [[intercession]]s of the Virgin Mary.\n\n===Islam===\n{{Main|Hijab}}\n[[File:N¬∞3 HA√èK alt version.jpg|thumbnail|Women in the predominantly Islamic country of Algeria wearing a [[ha√Øk]], a type of veil.]]A variety of headdresses worn by [[Women in Islam|Muslim women]] and girls in accordance with \'\'[[hijab]]\'\' (the principle of dressing modestly) are sometimes referred to as veils. The principal aim of the Muslim veil is to cover the [[Intimate parts in Islam|\'\'Awrah\'\']] (parts of the body that are considered private). Many of these garments cover the hair, ears, and throat, but do not cover the face.\n\nDepending on geography and culture, the veil is referenced and worn in different ways. The \'\'[[Hijab|khimar]]\'\' is a type of [[headscarf]]. The \'\'[[niqƒÅb]]\'\' and \'\'[[burqa]]\'\' are two kinds of veils that cover most of the face except for a slit or hole for the eyes. In [[Algeria]], a larger veil called the \'\'[[ha√Øk]]\'\' includes a triangular panel to cover the lower part of the face.<ref>Kellou, Doroth√©e Myriam.

Accessed on 5 March 2016.</ref> In the Arabian Peninsula and parts of North Africa (specifically Saudi Arabia), the abaya is worn constructed like a loose robe covering everything but the face itself. In another location, such as Iran, the chador is worn as the semicircles of fabric are draped over the head like a shawl and held in place under the neck by hand. The two terms for veiling that are directly mentioned in the Quran is the jilbab and the khimar. In these references, the veiling is meant to promote modesty by covering the genitals and breasts of women.\n\nThe [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] burqa covers the entire body, obscuring the face completely, except for a grille or netting over the eyes to allow the wearer to see. The \'\'[[boshiya]]\'\' is a veil that may be worn over a headscarf; it covers the entire face and is made of a sheer fabric so the wearer is able to see through it.

The most often cited interpretation for the \'\'badeken\'\' is that, according to {{bibleverse||Genesis|29|HE}}, when Jacob went to marry Rachel, his father-in-law Laban tricked him into marrying Leah, Rachel\'s older and homelier sister.\n\nMany say that the veiling ceremony takes place to make sure that the groom is marrying the right bride. Some say that as the groom places the veil over his bride, he makes an implicit promise to clothe and protect her. Finally, by covering her face, the groom recognizes that he is marrying the bride for her inner beauty; while looks will fade with time, his love will be everlasting.<ref name=":6" /> In some ultra-orthodox communities, it is a custom for the bride to wear an opaque veil as she is escorted to the groom. This is said to show her complete willingness to enter into the marriage and her absolute trust that she is marrying the right man.\n\nIn ancient Judaism, the lifting of the veil took place just prior to the consummation of the marriage in sexual union. The uncovering or unveiling that takes place in the [[wedding ceremony]] is a symbol of what will take place in the marriage bed. Just as the two become one through their words spoken in wedding vows, so these words are a sign of the physical oneness that they will consummate later on. The lifting of the veil is a symbol and anticipation of this.<ref name=":9" /><ref name="surprisingly" />\n\n=== Christianity ===\n[[File:Memchu wedding.jpg|thumb|300px|A Christian minister marries a groom and bride, the latter of whom is wearing a wedding veil in the church]]\n{{further|Christian headcovering}}\nIn Christian theology, [[Saint Paul|St. Paul\'s]] words concerning how marriage symbolizes the union of Christ and His Church underlie part of the tradition of veiling in the marriage ceremony.<ref name="eph5">{{Biblesource|ref=yes|Ephesians|5|ASV}}</ref><ref name=":4" /> In historic Christian traditions, the veil is seen as "a visible sign that the woman is under the authority of a man" and that she is submitting herself to her husband\'s Christ-like leadership and loving care.<ref name=":13" /><ref name="cor11">{{biblesource|1 Corinthians|11:4|ref=yes|1 Corinthians 11:4‚Äì16}}</ref>\n\nThe removing of the veil can be seen as a symbol of the temple veil that was torn when Christ died, giving believers direct access to God, and in the same way, the bride and the groom, once married, now have full access to one another.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Biblesource |ref=yes |1 Corinthians| 7:4|ASV}}</ref>\n\n==== Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====\nIn 2019 a letter by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] President [[Russell M.
