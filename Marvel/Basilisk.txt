According to the \'\'[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]\'\' of [[Pliny the Elder]], the basilisk of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] is a small snake, "being not more than twelve fingers in length",<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], \'\'Natural History\'\', [http://attalus.org/translate/pliny_hn8a.html#78 viii.(33).78].</ref> that is so [[venom]]ous, it leaves a wide trail of deadly venom in its wake, and its gaze is likewise lethal.\n\nThe basilisk\'s weakness is the odor of the [[weasel]], which, according to Pliny, was thrown into the basilisk\'s hole, recognizable because some of the surrounding shrubs and grass had been scorched by its presence. It is possible that the legend of the basilisk and its association with the weasel in [[Europe]] was inspired by accounts of certain species of Asiatic snakes (such as the [[king cobra]]) and their natural predator, the [[mongoose]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word originates from the Greek form \'\'basilískos\'\' ({{lang-el|βασιλίσκος}}; {{lang-la|basiliscus}}), which means "little king", "little [[prince]]", "[[chieftain]]", or "young [[ruler]]", from two components βᾰσῐλεύς (basileús, “king”) and -ῐ́σκος (-ískos, diminutive<ref name="NapoliRavetto2017">{{cite book|editor1=Maria Napoli|editor2=Miriam Ravetto|title=Exploring Intensification: Synchronic, diachronic and cross-linguistic perspectives|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUw4DwAAQBAJ&q=%C3%ADskos&pg=PA127|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-6512-8|page=127|last=Meluzzi|first=Chiara|chapter=Diminutives in Ancient Greek|date=30 September 2017}}</ref>).

Stories of the basilisk show that it is not completely distinguished from the [[cockatrice]]. The basilisk is alleged to be hatched by a [[cockerel]] from the egg of a [[snake|serpent]] or [[True toad|toad]] (the reverse of the cockatrice, which was hatched from a cockerel\'s "egg" incubated by a serpent or toad).<!--whose neat polarity is this?--> In [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]], the description of the creature began taking on features from cockerels. It has a venomous strike and in some versions of the myth, it has the ability to breathe fire.\n\nOne of the earliest accounts of the basilisk comes from [[Pliny the Elder]]\'s \'\'[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]\'\', written in roughly 79 AD. He describes the [[catoblepas]], a monstrous cow-like creature of which "all who behold its eyes, fall dead upon the spot",<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], \'\'Natural History\'\', [http://attalus.org/translate/pliny_hn8a.html#77 viii.(32).77].</ref> and then goes on to say,\n\n{{blockquote|There is the same power also in the serpent called the basilisk. It is produced in the province of [[Cyrenaica|Cyrene]], being not more than twelve fingers in length. It has a white spot on the head, strongly resembling a sort of a diadem. When it hisses, all the other serpents fly from it: and it does not advance its body, like the others, by a succession of folds, but moves along upright and erect upon the middle. It destroys all shrubs, not only by its contact, but those even that it has breathed upon; it burns up all the grass, too, and breaks the stones, so tremendous is its noxious influence. It was formerly a general belief that if a man on horseback killed one of these animals with a spear, the poison would run up the weapon and kill, not only the rider, but the horse, as well. To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing that has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of nature against its own self.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Natural History|editor=Pliny the Elder |translator=John Bostock |translator2=H.T.

[[Alexander Neckam]] (died 1217) was the first to say that not the glare but the "air corruption" was the killing tool of the basilisk, a theory developed a century later by [[Pietro d\'Abano]].\n\n[[Theophilus Presbyter]] gave a long recipe in his book, the \'\'Schedula diversarum artium\'\', for creating a compound to convert [[copper]] into "Spanish gold" (\'\'De auro hyspanico\'\').  The compound was formed by combining powdered basilisk blood, powdered human blood, red copper, and a special kind of vinegar.\n\n[[Albertus Magnus]] in the \'\'De animalibus\'\' wrote about the killing gaze of the basilisk, but he denied other legends, such as the rooster hatching the egg. He gave as source of those legends [[Hermes Trismegistus]], who is credited also as the creator of the story about the basilisk\'s ashes being able to convert [[silver]] into [[gold]]. The attribution is absolutely incorrect, but it shows how the legends of the basilisk were already linked to [[alchemy]] in the 13th century.\n[[File:Munchen Basilisk.JPG|thumb|A [[putto]] kills a basilisk, symbolic of [[Thirty Years\' War#Swedish intervention (1630–1635)|Swedish occupiers]] and Protestant heresy, on the \'\'[[Mariensäule]]\'\', Munich, erected in 1638.]]\n\n[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] featured a \'\'basilicok\'\' (as he called it, possibly in relation to the [[Rooster|cock]]) in his \'\'[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]\'\'.

Some writers even claimed it could kill not only by touch, but also by touching something that is touching the victim, like a sword held in the hand. Also, some stories claim its breath is highly toxic and will cause death, usually immediately. The basilisk is also the guardian creature and traditional symbol of the Swiss city [[Basel]] ({{lang-la | Basilea}}). [[Canting arms|Canting]] basilisks appear as [[supporter]]s in the city\'s arms.<ref>\n[https://www.staatskanzlei.bs.ch/kommunikation/baselstab.html "Als Schildhalter dient seit dem Ende des 15.

In his notebooks, he describes the basilisk in an account clearly dependent directly or indirectly on Pliny\'s:\n\n{{blockquote|This is found in the province of [[Cyrenaica]] and is not more than 12 fingers long. It has on its head a white spot after the fashion of a [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]]. It scares all serpents with its whistling. It resembles a snake, but does not move by wriggling but from the centre forwards to the right. It is said that one of these, being killed with a spear by one who was on horse-back, and its venom flowing on the spear, not only the man but the horse also died. It spoils the wheat and not only that which it touches, but where it breathes the grass dries and the stones are split.}}\n\nThen Leonardo noted of the [[weasel]] "this beast finding the lair of the basilisk kills it with the smell of its urine, and this smell, indeed, often kills the weasel itself."\n\n[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] wrote that the basilisk "is alwayes, and cannot but be a male, as the more proper receptacle of venome and destructive qualities."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/preem.htm|title=Agrippa: Declamatio de nobilitate & precellentia Fœminei sexus.

This animal is born from an egg laid by an old cock just before his death exactly at midnight on a clear night with a full moon. Within a few days, the egg shell, which is not hard, but rather soft and leathery, is opened by the strange creature, which already has all the features of an adult: legs, beak, cockscomb, and reptilian body. Apparently, the creature has an intense and penetrating fire in its eyes such that any animal or person gazing directly upon it would die. The weasel is the only animal that can face and even attack it. It can only be killed with the crowing of a rooster, so, until very recent times, travelers carried a rooster when they ventured into areas where it was said that the basilisks lived.<ref name=llano>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Fernández\n  | first = Pollux\n  | title = Monstruos, duendes, y seres fantásticos de la Mitología cántabra\n  | publisher = Anaya\n  | location = Madrid\n  | year = 1994\n  | language = es\n  | isbn =978-84-207-5630-1\n}}\n</ref>\n\nA basilisk is said to have terrorised the inhabitants of [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]] during the reign of Grand Duke [[Sigismund August]].

Nineteenth-century historian Teodoras Narbutas ([[Teodor Narbutt]]) claimed the location of the creature\'s lair had been at the intersection of Bokšto, Subačiaus and Bastėjos streets, near [[Subačius Gate]].

Cobras can maintain an upright posture, and, as with many snakes in overlapping territories, are often killed by [[mongoose]]s. The [[king cobra]] or hamadryad has a crown-like symbol on its head. Several species of [[spitting cobras]] can incapacitate from a distance by spitting venom, most often into the prey\'s eyes, and may well have been confused with the hamadryad by their similar appearance.
