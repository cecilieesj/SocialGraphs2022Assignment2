However, Cooper 2000, p. 10, writes: "His parents also gave him a middle name, which by early manhood he dropped completely; only the initial F. survived."; and again Cooper 2000, p. 711 n. 1, writes: "Some have also questioned whether Davis ever had a middle name.

He previously served as the [[United States Secretary of War]] from 1853 to 1857 under President [[Franklin Pierce]].\n\nDavis was born in [[Fairview, Kentucky]], to a moderately prosperous farmer, the youngest of ten children. He grew up in [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi]], and also lived in [[Louisiana]]. His eldest brother [[Joseph Emory Davis]] secured the younger Davis\'s appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]]. After graduating, Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the [[United States Army]]. He fought in the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), as the colonel of a volunteer regiment.

While not disgraced, Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general, [[Robert E. Lee]]. Davis wrote a memoir entitled \'\'[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]\'\', which he completed in 1881. By the late 1880s, he began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union. Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war, seeing him as a Southern patriot.

He married the widow Lydia Emory Williams, who had two sons from a previous marriage, and their son Samuel Emory Davis was born in 1756. He served in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], along with his two older half-brothers. In 1783, after the war, he married Jane Cook. She was born in 1759 to William Cook and his wife Sarah Simpson in what is now [[Christian County, Kentucky]].

Three of his older brothers served in the [[War of 1812]]. In 1813, Davis began his education at the Wilkinson Academy in the small town of [[Woodville, Mississippi|Woodville]], near the family cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]]. His brother Joseph acted as a surrogate father and encouraged Jefferson in his education. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at [[St. Rose Priory]], a school operated by the [[Dominican Order]] in [[Washington County, Kentucky]]. At the time, he was the only Protestant student at the school. Davis returned to Mississippi in 1818, studying at [[Jefferson College (Mississippi)|Jefferson College]] in [[Washington, Mississippi|Washington]]. He returned to Kentucky in 1821, studying at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]. (At the time, these colleges were like academies, roughly equivalent to high schools.)<ref>Strode, 1955, pp. 11–27.</ref> His father Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when Jefferson was 16 years old.<ref>Strode 1955, pp. 4–5.</ref>\n\n===Early military career===\nJoseph arranged for Davis to get an appointment and attend the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) starting in late 1824.<ref name=hamilton>{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Holman |title=The Three Kentucky Presidents |chapter=Jefferson Davis Before His Presidency |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington |year=1978 |isbn=9780813102467 |url=https://archive.org/details/threekentuckypre00hami }}</ref> While there, he was placed under house arrest for his role in the [[Eggnog Riot]] during Christmas 1826. Cadets smuggled whiskey into the academy to make eggnog, and more than a third of the cadets were involved. In June 1828, Davis graduated 23rd in a class of 33.<ref>U.S. Military Academy, \'\'Register of Officers and Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy from March 16 to January 1, 1850\'\'.

[[Zachary Taylor]], a future [[president of the United States]], had assumed command shortly before Davis arrived in early 1829. In March 1832, Davis returned to Mississippi on furlough, having had no leave since he first arrived at Fort Crawford. He was still in Mississippi during the [[Black Hawk War]] but returned to the fort in August. At the conclusion of the war, Colonel Taylor assigned him to escort [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] to prison. Davis made an effort to shield Black Hawk from curiosity seekers, and the chief noted in his autobiography that Davis treated him "with much kindness" and showed empathy for the leader\'s situation as a prisoner.<ref>Strode 1955, p. 76. [[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 53–55.</ref>\n\n==First marriage and aftermath==\nDavis fell in love with [[Sarah Knox Taylor]], daughter of his commanding officer, Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylor\'s permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have the difficult life of a military wife on frontier army posts.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 65.</ref> Davis\'s own experience led him to appreciate Taylor\'s objection. He consulted his older brother [[Joseph Emory Davis|Joseph]], and they both began to question the value of an Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835.<ref>Strode 1955, pp. 86–94.</ref> He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 when he did not return from leave,<ref>Davis 1996, pp. 70–71.</ref> but he did not tell Taylor he intended to resign.<ref>Davis 1996, p. 69.</ref> Against his former commander\'s wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

The [[Wilmot Proviso]], introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, it would have banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The [[Compromise of 1850]] brought a temporary respite, but the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] case, decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice [[Roger Taney]] ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that African Americans had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union.<ref>Dodd 1909, pp. 122–29.</ref>\n\nDavis\'s renewed service in the Senate was interrupted in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him with the loss of his left eye. He was forced to remain in a darkened room for four weeks.<ref>Allen 1999, p. 232.</ref> He spent the summer of 1858 in [[Portland, Maine]]. On the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near [[Boston]]. He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in [[Faneuil Hall]], Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.<ref>Dodd 1907, pp. 12, 171–72.</ref>\n\nAs he explained in his memoir \'\'The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\'\', Davis believed each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union. At the same time, he counseled delay among his fellow Southerners, because he did not think the North would permit the peaceable exercise of the right to secession. Having served as secretary of war under President Pierce, he also knew the South lacked the military and naval resources necessary for defense in a war. Following the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]], however, events accelerated. [[South Carolina]] adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20, 1860, and Mississippi did so on January 9, 1861. Davis had expected this but waited until he received official notification. On January 21, the day Davis called "the saddest day of my life",<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 3.</ref> he delivered a farewell address to the United States Senate, [[resignation from the United States Senate|resigned]] and returned to Mississippi.<ref name="jeffdavissenatefarewell">{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Jefferson_Davis_Farewell.htm |publisher=United States Senate |title=Jefferson Davis\'s Farewell |access-date=June 9, 2011 |archive-date=March 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301111146/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Jefferson_Davis_Farewell.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1861, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] split and Davis became a member of the newly founded [[Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America]].

Davis sent a commission to Washington with an offer to pay for any federal property on Southern soil, as well as the Southern portion of the national debt, but Lincoln refused to meet with the commissioners. Brief informal discussions did take place with Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] through [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[John Archibald Campbell|John A. Campbell]], the latter of whom later resigned from the federal government, as he was from Alabama. Seward hinted that [[Fort Sumter]] would be evacuated, but gave no assurance.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 361–62.</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1861, Davis appointed General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] to command all [[Confederate States Army|Confederate troops]] in the vicinity of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geopolitical posturing but of survival. They would be out of food on the 15th. The small Union garrison had but half a dozen officers and 127 soldiers under Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]]. Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Captain (later major general) [[Abner Doubleday]]. More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce [[Fort Pickens]] in Florida and Fort Sumter. The U.S. President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. For Lincoln, Davis, as the leader of an insurrection, was without legal standing in U.S. affairs. To deal with him would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. The fact that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fort. He informed Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would begin and the flotilla watched the spectacle from {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} at sea.\n\nDavis faced the most important decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, to use military force to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Anderson did not surrender. With Davis\'s endorsement, Beauregard began the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|bombarding of the fort]] in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one was killed in the artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fort meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up 75,000 state militiamen to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 337–40.</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=David Herbert|last=Donald|title=Lincoln|url=https://archive.org/details/lincoln00dona|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lincoln00dona/page/285 285–99]}}</ref><ref>Strode 1959, pp. 24–66.</ref><ref>McPherson 1989, pp. 273–75.</ref>\n\n===Overseeing the war effort===\n\nWhen [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]] joined the Confederacy, Davis moved his government to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in May 1861.

Lee]] to replace the wounded [[Joseph E. Johnston]] to command of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the main Confederate army in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]]. That December Davis made a tour of Confederate armies in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|west of the country]]. He had a very small circle of military advisers. He largely made the main strategic decisions on his own, though he had special respect for Lee\'s views. Given the Confederacy\'s limited resources compared with the Union, Davis decided the Confederacy would have to fight mostly on the strategic defensive. He maintained this outlook throughout the war, paying special attention to the defense of his national capital at Richmond. He approved Lee\'s strategic offensives when he felt that military success would both shake Northern self-confidence and strengthen the peace movements there. However, the several campaigns invading the North were met with defeat. A bloody battle at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] in Maryland as well as the ride into Kentucky, the [[Confederate Heartland Offensive]] (both in 1862)<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 401–02.</ref> drained irreplaceable men and talented officers.

The status of techniques and munitions made the defensive side much more likely to endure: an expensive lesson vindicating Davis\'s initial belief.\n\n===Administration and cabinet===\n[[File:ConfederateCabinet.jpg|thumb|left|The original [[Confederate States of America#Executive|Confederate Cabinet]]. From left: [[Judah P. Benjamin]], [[Stephen Mallory]], [[Christopher Memminger]], [[Alexander H. Stephens]], [[LeRoy Pope Walker]], Jefferson Davis, [[John H. Reagan]] and [[Robert Toombs]].]]\n\nAs provisional president in 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet. Robert Toombs of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] was the first Secretary of State and [[Christopher Memminger]] of [[South Carolina]] became Secretary of the Treasury. [[LeRoy Pope Walker]] of Alabama was made Secretary of War, after being recommended for this post by [[Clement Claiborne Clay|Clement Clay]] and [[William Lowndes Yancey|William Yancey]] (both of whom declined to accept cabinet positions themselves). [[John Henninger Reagan|John Reagan]] of [[Texas]] became Postmaster General. [[Judah P. Benjamin]] of [[Louisiana]] became Attorney General. Although [[Stephen Mallory]] was not put forward by the delegation from his state of [[Florida]], Davis insisted that he was the best man for the job of Secretary of the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed.<ref>Patrick 1944, p. 51.</ref>\n\nSince the Confederacy was founded, among other things, on states\' rights, one important factor in Davis\'s choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.<ref>Patrick 1944, pp. 49–50, 56.</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, this dissatisfaction increased and there were frequent changes to the cabinet. Toombs, who had wished to be president himself, was frustrated as an advisor and resigned within a few months of his appointment to join the army. [[Robert M. T. Hunter|Robert Hunter]] of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861.<ref>Patrick 1944, pp. 53, 89.</ref> On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had suggested he consider a different position. Walker requested, and was given, command of the troops in Alabama. Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and [[Thomas Bragg]] of North Carolina (brother of General [[Braxton Bragg]]) took Benjamin\'s place as Attorney General.<ref>Patrick 1944, pp. 53, 116–17.</ref>\n[[File:CSA-T16-$50-1862.jpg|thumb|Davis was first depicted on [[Confederate States dollar|CSA notes]] issued between April and December 1862.]]\n\nFollowing the [[1861 Confederate States presidential election|November 1861 election]], Davis announced the permanent cabinet in March 1862. Benjamin moved again, to Secretary of State. [[George W. Randolph]] of Virginia had been made the Secretary of War. Mallory continued as Secretary of the Navy and Reagan as Postmaster General. Both kept their positions throughout the war. Memminger remained Secretary of the Treasury, while [[Thomas Hill Watts]] of Alabama was made Attorney General.<ref>Patrick 1944, pp. 55–57.</ref>\n\nIn 1862 Randolph resigned from the War Department, and [[James Seddon]] of Virginia was appointed to replace him. In late 1863, Watts resigned as Attorney General to take office as the Governor of Alabama, and [[George Davis (Confederate States politician)|George Davis]] of North Carolina took his place. In 1864, Memminger withdrew from the Treasury post due to congressional opposition, and was replaced by [[George Trenholm]] of South Carolina. In 1865 congressional opposition likewise caused Seddon to withdraw, and he was replaced by [[John C. Breckinridge]] of [[Kentucky]].<ref>Patrick 1944, p. 57.</ref>\n\nCotton was the South\'s primary export and the basis of its economy and the system of production the South used was dependent upon slave labor. At the outset of the Civil War, Davis realized that intervention from European powers would be vital if the Confederacy was to stand against the Union. The administration sent repeated delegations to European nations, but several factors prevented Southern success in terms of foreign diplomacy. The [[Union blockade]] of the Confederacy led European powers to remain neutral, contrary to the Southern belief that a blockade would cut off the supply of cotton to Britain and other European nations and prompt them to intervene on behalf of the South. Many European countries objected to slavery. Britain had abolished it in the 1830s, and Lincoln\'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863 made support for the South even less appealing in Europe. Finally, as the war progressed and the South\'s military prospects dwindled, foreign powers were not convinced that the Confederacy had the strength to become independent.

Davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all Southern territory with ostensibly equal effort. This diluted the limited resources of the South and made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by the Union into the vital Western Theater (e.g., the capture of [[New Orleans]] in early 1862). He made other controversial strategic choices, such as allowing Lee to invade the North in 1862 and 1863 while the Western armies were under very heavy pressure. When Lee lost at Gettysburg in July 1863, [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] simultaneously fell, and the Union took control of the [[Mississippi River]], splitting the Confederacy. At Vicksburg, the failure to coordinate multiple forces on both sides of the Mississippi River rested primarily on Davis\'s inability to create a harmonious departmental arrangement or to force such generals as [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], [[Earl Van Dorn]], and [[Theophilus H. Holmes]] to work together.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Steven E. |last=Woodworth |title=Dismembering the Confederacy: Jefferson Davis and the Trans-Mississippi West |journal=Military History of the Southwest |year=1990 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–22}}</ref> In fact, during the late stages of the [[Franklin–Nashville Campaign]], Davis warned Beauregard that Kirby Smith would prove uncooperative to whatever proposal the Creole general had in mind for him.<ref name="Hood 189-94">Hood, Stephen M. \'\'John Bell Hood: The Rise, Fall, and Resurrection of a Confederate General\'\'.

His elder brother [[Joseph Emory Davis|Joseph]] died in 1870, his son William Howell Davis in 1872 and Jefferson Davis Jr. in 1878. His wife Varina was often ill or abroad, and for a time refused to live with him in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Davis resented having to resort to charity, and would accept only jobs befitting his former positions as U.S. Senator and Confederate President; several that he accepted proved financial failures.<ref>Collins 2005, p. 20.</ref>\n\nDavis sought a mercantile position in [[Liverpool, England]]. However, British companies were wary, both because Britons were not interested in Canadian mines, and because Mississippi had defaulted on debts in the 1840s, and [[Judah Benjamin]] cautioned him against countering former wartime propaganda by [[Robert J. Walker]].<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 582.</ref> Davis also refused positions as head of [[Randolph-Macon Academy]] in Virginia and the [[University of the South]] in [[Sewanee, Tennessee]], for financial reasons.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 586.</ref>\n\nIn 1869, Davis became president of the Carolina Life Insurance Company in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], at an annual salary of $12,000 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|12000|1869|fmt=eq}}), plus travel expenses, and resided at the [[Peabody Hotel]]. He recruited former Confederate officers as agents, and the board ratified his position in 1870.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 586–88, 594.</ref> By 1873, he suggested that the company have boards of trustees at its various branches, and that qualification for such be that the trustee either take out a policy of at least $5,000 or own at least $1,000 in the company\'s stock.<ref>Letter to W.T. Walthall from Memphis, Tennessee dated March 14, 1873 in William J.

He drafted a prospectus that stated he owed more than $40,000 and his income did not amount to $200.<ref>Collins 2005, p. 50.</ref>\n\nUpon General Lee\'s death, Davis agreed to preside over the Presbyterian memorial in Richmond on November 3, 1870. That speech prompted further invitations, although he declined them until July 1871, when he was commencement speaker at the [[University of the South]]. Two years later Davis addressed the [[Virginia Historical Society]] at [[White Sulphur Springs, Virginia|White Sulpher Springs]], where Davis proclaimed southerners were "cheated not conquered" and would never have surrendered if they had foreseen [[Congressional Reconstruction]].<ref name="Collins 2005, p. 21">Collins 2005, p. 21.</ref> In the summer of 1875, Davis agreed to speak at 17 agricultural fairs in the Midwest. He received criticism from the \'\'[[Chicago Tribune]]\'\' and threats to his life in Indiana, but crowds in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and [[Fairview, Kentucky]], received him well. During the next two years Davis began writing his books about the Confederacy, but addressed only fellow former soldiers: first veterans of the Mexican War (before which he attacked Congressional Reconstruction), then Confederate veterans (where he promoted reconciliation).<ref name="Collins 2005, p. 21"/>\n\nEarly in [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], Davis publicly remained silent on his opinions, but privately condemned federal military rule and believed Republican authority over former Confederate states unjustified. Mississippi had elected [[Hiram Rhodes Revels]], an African-American, as a U.S. Senator in 1870 to finish the term of [[Albert G. Brown]]. Furthermore, during the war, after Joseph Davis\'s departure from his plantations at [[Davis Bend]] and the Union capture of Vicksburg and the surrounding area, General Grant had continued Joseph Davis\'s utopian experiment and ordered that the land be leased to the freedman and black refugees allowed to settle in the area. Although Joseph Davis ultimately received the land back, many black leaders came from the plantation, which had its own political system, including elected black judges and sheriffs. After the 1867 floods changed the course of the Mississippi River, Joseph Davis sold the plantation to the former slave who had operated a store and handled the white brothers\' cotton transaction, [[Ben Montgomery]]. Ben\'s son [[Isaiah Montgomery|Isaiah Thornton Montgomery]] became the first black person to hold office in Mississippi when General E.O.C. Ord appointed him Davis Bend\'s postmaster in 1867. Ben himself was elected justice of the peace. Other black leaders during Mississippi Reconstruction with Davis Bend ties included Israel Shadd, who became speaker of the state\'s House of Representatives, and legislator Albert Johnson (who also served in the state\'s constitutional convention).<ref>Foner 1988, pp. 58–59.</ref>\n\nJefferson Davis considered "Yankee and Negroe" rule in the South oppressive, and said so in 1871 and especially after 1873.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 602–3 and notes, although no footnotes given for quotations in most relevant paragraph on p. 602</ref> Like many of his contemporaries, Davis believed blacks were inferior to whites. One recent biographer believes Davis favored a [[Treatment of slaves in the United States|Southern social order]] that included a "democratic white polity based firmly on dominance of a controlled and excluded black caste".<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp.574–575, 602–603; the associated footnote cites only to letters.</ref>\n\nWhile seeking to reclaim Davis Bend ("Hurricane" and "Brierfield" plantations) in 1865, Joseph Davis had filed documents with the [[Freedmans Bureau]] insisting that he had intentionally never given Jefferson Davis title to the latter. After receiving first a pardon, and then the lands back, he sold both plantations to former slave [[Ben Montgomery]] and his sons, taking back a mortgage for $300,000 at six percent interest, with payments due each January{{nbs}}1 beginning in 1867.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 572–74.</ref> While Joseph Davis recognized he could not farm successfully without his 375 slaves, he expected the Montgomerys could better manage the labor situation, since in 1865 they had raised nearly 2000 bales of cotton and earned $160,000 in profits.<ref>Foner 1988, p. 59.</ref> However, when the Mississippi River flooded in spring 1867, it also changed course, ruining many acres and creating "Davis Island". After Joseph Davis died two years later, his 1869 will left property to his two orphaned grandchildren, as well as to his brother\'s children, and named Jefferson Davis one of three executors (with Dr. J. H. D. Bowmar and nephew Joseph Smith). After the Montgomery men entertained the three executors in May 1870, and he suffered losses in the [[Panic of 1873]], Jefferson Davis decided the black men could never fulfill the land purchase contract, and filed suit against the other trustees on June 15, 1874.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 597–98; however accompanying notes cite only letters and Everett, \'\'Brierfield\'\' Chap. 10 and various pages of Hermann\'s \'\'Pursuit\'\'</ref> Jefferson Davis argued his late brother had an oral agreement with Ben Montgomery that allowed Jefferson Davis to rescind the deal and that an unassigned $70,000 from the land sale represented Brierfield\'s value (the orphaned Hamer grandchildren said it represented declining land values). The local Chancery Court (which then had a Republican judge, and two of the three Hamer lawyers were former Confederates) dismissed Davis\'s lawsuit in January 1876, citing [[estoppel]], because Davis had been acting as executor for four years despite this claim based on alleged actions in the 1840s.<ref>55 Miss. Rep. 671–814 (1878) according to Collins 2005, p. 604 and 729n.74</ref> In April 1878 (months after Ben Montgomery had died), the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] overruled the [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren County]] chancery court, deciding that Jefferson Davis properly claimed the Brierfield land by adverse possession, since he had cleared and farmed it from the 1840s until the outbreak of the Civil War (more than the ten years the statute required). By that time, two of the Republicans on that appellate court had been replaced by Democrats, both former Confederate officers.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 628.</ref> To actually gain possession of Brierfield, Davis needed to convince the Warren County chancery court to foreclose the mortgage, which happened on June 1, 1880, and all appeals were rejected by December 1, 1881, allowing Jefferson Davis (for the first time in his life), to gain legal title.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 629; however the accompanying n.36 at p. 733 cites only Everett \'\'Brierfield\'\' Ch. 10.</ref>\n\nWhile pursuing the Brierfield litigation, Davis took another business trip to Liverpool. This time he sought employment from the Royal Insurance Company (a fire and marine insurer) which refused him, citing Northern animosity toward the former Confederate President. Other insurers also rejected him both directly and through intermediaries. He then visited former Confederate ambassador [[John Slidell]] in [[Paris]], but was unable to associate with a land company, either to aid the southern people or encourage emigration to the South.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 599–600</ref> Davis returned to the United States and blamed race as the heart of what he called "the night of despotism" enveloping the South, citing Republicans who gave political rights to blacks that made them "more idle and ungovernable than before."<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 603.</ref> Davis also investigated mine properties in Arkansas and backed an ice-making machine venture, which failed.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 604–5</ref> He was invited to Texas, but turned down the opportunity to become the first president of the [[History of Texas A&M University#Early years|Agriculture and Mechanical College of Texas]] (now Texas A&M University) in 1876, citing the financial sacrifice. (The offered annual salary was only $4,000.)<ref>Strode 1964, pp. 402–4.</ref> The Mississippi Valley Society, based in England, sought to spur European immigration and English investment, but Davis declined to accept that presidency until salary details had been settled, though he took a speaking tour of the area to drum up public support.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 605–6.</ref>\n\n==Author==\nJoseph Davis had encouraged his brother to write his memoirs just after his release from prison, but Davis had responded that he was not capable of doing so, neither physically nor emotionally. His wartime assistant Preston Johnston had also encouraged Davis three years later. As Davis began to seriously consider the memoir endeavor in 1869, his early working title became "Our Cause," for he believed he could convert others to the rightness of the Confederacy\'s actions.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 614.</ref> In 1875, unable to come to terms with Preston Johnston, Davis authorized William T. Walthall, a former Confederate officer and Carolina Life agent in [[Mobile, Alabama]], to look for a publisher for the proposed book. Walthall contacted [[D. Appleton & Company]] in New York City, and editor Joseph C. Derby agreed to pay Walthall $250/month as an advance until the manuscript\'s completion, with the final product not to exceed two volumes of 800 pages each. Davis made minor changes and Appleton agreed.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 616.</ref>\n\nIn 1877, [[Sarah Anne Ellis Dorsey]], a wealthy widow and writer whom he and Varina had known from childhood and who supported the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]], invited Davis to stay at her estate and plantation house, "[[Beauvoir (Biloxi, Mississippi)|Beauvoir]]", which faced the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]. Her husband, Maryland-born [[Samuel Worthington Dorsey|Samuel Dorsey]] had bought Beauvoir in 1873, and died there two years later.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 611 et seq.</ref> Mrs. Dorsey wanted to provide Davis with a refuge in which he could write his memoirs per the Appleton contract. She provided him a cabin for his own use as well as helped him with his writing through organization, dictation, editing and encouragement. Davis refused to accept overt charity, but agreed to purchase the property at a modest price ($5,500, payable in installments over three years).<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 629.</ref> In January 1878 Dorsey, knowing she too was ill (with breast cancer), made over her will with Walthall\'s assistance in order to leave her remaining three small Louisiana plantations and financial assets of $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50,000|1878|2017|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to Davis and (acknowledging his still-precarious health) if he predeceased her, to his beloved daughter, Winnie Davis.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 676–78.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Bertram |last=Wyatt-Brown |author-link=Bertram Wyatt-Brown |title=The House of Percy: Honor, Melancholy and Imagination in a Southern Family |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |pages=165–66}}</ref><ref name="Collins 2005, p. 21"/> Dorsey died in 1879, by which time both the Davises and Winnie were living at Beauvoir. Her relatives came to contest that last will, which excluded them and gave everything to Davis in fee simple. They argued Davis exerted undue influence over the widow. The court dismissed their lawsuit without comment in March 1880, and they filed no appeal.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 630 and n37 p. 735 lists the case title as Stephen Percy Ellis, et al. v.

When Walthall sent two proposed chapters to New York in 1878, Appleton returned them, cautioning that it did not want a long rehash of constitutional history, but rather an account of Davis\'s actions as the Confederacy\'s president. The publisher then sent [[William J. Tenney]], a states-rights Democrat and staff member, to visit Beauvoir to get the problematic manuscript into publishable shape. When it still failed to arrive, Derby personally traveled to Mississippi in February 1880. By this time, Derby had advanced $8,000, but Davis confessed that he had seen few pages, asserting that Walthall had the rest. Since Davis did not want to give up on the book nor return the funds (and had already mortgaged the properties he received from Dorsey), he agreed that Tenney would take up residence in a cottage at Beauvoir. On May 1, 1880, Davis severed all connections with Walthall, who had made little progress in the preceding two years.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 617–619.</ref> Davis and Tenney then completed \'\'[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]\'\' (1881), in two volumes of 700 and 800 pages respectively.<ref>Strode 1964, pp. 439–41, 448–49.</ref><ref>Cooper, Collected Writings, p. 405.</ref>\n{{external media| float = left| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?162328-1/jefferson-davis-american \'\'Booknotes\'\' interview with William J.

Davis downplayed slavery as secession\'s cause, instead blaming the North for prosecuting a destructive and uncivilized war.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 618–619.</ref>\n\nThe [[Southern Historical Society]] had been formed in 1876 by Rev. [[J. William Jones]] (a Baptist minister and former Confederate chaplain) and Gen. [[Jubal A. Early]]. Jones became the Society\'s paid secretary and editor of the Southern Historical Review; Early became president and head of its executive committee. They made Davis a life member and helped him gather material for his book. They had tried to enlist him for a speaking tour in 1882, but Davis declined, citing his health and a yellow fever epidemic near Beauvoir, and made only one address in New Orleans on its behalf before 1882. Early also began visiting Davis when the Virginian visited New Orleans as supervisor in the Louisiana State Lottery Company.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 622 and notes on p. 732.</ref> Like Judah Benjamin, Early repeatedly advised Davis not to participate publicly in personal vendettas and old battles, despite critical books and articles by former Confederate Generals [[Pierre Beauregard]] and [[Joseph E. Johnston]]. Nonetheless, when asked to speak at dedication of the Lee mausoleum in Lexington, Virginia, Davis declined when he learned Johnston would preside, and also vented in his personal correspondence. Davis also took issue with Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] in an address in St. Louis in 1884 and in a lengthy letter to the editor, and also criticized young New York politician [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for comparing him to [[Benedict Arnold]].<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 623–624.</ref>\n\nWhen touring the South in 1886 and 1887, Davis attended many Lost Cause ceremonies, and large crowds showered him with affection as local leaders presented emotional speeches honoring his sacrifices to the would-be nation. According to the \'\'[[Meriden Daily Journal]]\'\', at a reception held in New Orleans in May 1887, Davis urged southerners to be loyal to the nation{{snd}}"United you are now, and if the Union is ever to be broken, let the other side break it." He continued by lauding Confederate men who successfully fought for their own rights despite inferior numbers during the Civil War, and argued that northern historians ignored this view.<ref name="Meriden">{{cite news |title=Jefferson Davis\' Loyalty |newspaper=The Meriden Daily Journal |date=May 14, 1887 |page=1}}</ref> Davis firmly believed Confederate secession was constitutional, and he was optimistic concerning American prosperity and the next generation.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], p. 658.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1888, James Redpath, editor of the \'\'[[North American Review]]\'\' and a former political enemy who became an admirer upon meeting Davis, convinced him to write a series of articles at $250 per article, as well as a book.<ref>Collins 2005, p. 49.</ref> Davis then completed his final book \'\'[[A Short History of the Confederate States of America]]\'\' in October 1889.\n\n==Death and burials==\n[[File:JeffDavisFuneralOnCampStreet1889.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession of Jefferson Davis in [[New Orleans]]]]\n\nOn November 6, 1889, Davis left Beauvoir to visit his Brierfield plantation. He embarked a steamboat in New Orleans during sleety rain and fell ill during the trip, so that he initially felt too sick to disembark at his stop, and spent the night upriver in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] before making his way to the plantation the next day. He refused to send for a doctor for four days before embarking on his return trip. Meanwhile, servants sent Varina a telegram, and she took a train to New Orleans, and then a steamboat upriver, finally reaching the vessel on which her husband was returning. Davis finally received medical care as two doctors came aboard further south and diagnosed acute [[bronchitis]] complicated by [[malaria]].<ref>Strode 1964, pp. 505–07.</ref><ref>Collins 2005, pp. 50–51.</ref> Upon arriving in New Orleans three days later, Davis was taken to [[Garden District, New Orleans#Landmarks|Garden District]] home of [[Charles Erasmus Fenner]], a former Confederate officer who became an Associate Justice of the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]]. Fenner was the son-in-law of Davis\'s old friend J. M. Payne. Davis\'s doctor Stanford E. Chaille pronounced him too ill to travel to Beauvoir; a Catholic nun, and four medical students who were sons of Confederate veterans, attended Davis in the Charity Hospital ambulance which took him to the Fenner home. Davis remained bedridden but stable for the next two weeks. He took a turn for the worse in early December. According to Fenner, just when Davis again appeared to be improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December{{nbs}}5 and died at 12:45{{nbs}}a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, holding Varina\'s hand and in the presence of several friends.<ref>[[#cooper|Cooper 2000]], pp. 652–54.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://leefamilyarchive.org/reference/misc/fenner/index.html |title=Eulogy of Robert E.

An Executive Committee decided to emphasize his ties to the United States, so an American national flag was placed over the Confederate flag during the viewing, with many crossed American and Confederate flags nearby. Davis wore a new suit of Confederate grey fabric [[Jubal Early]] had given him, and Varina placed a sword Davis had carried during the [[Black Hawk War]] on the bier.

As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful.<ref name="strode-1955-164-167"/> As a politician, he served as a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, although he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported [[slavery in the United States|slavery]].<ref name="cooper-2000-75-79"/> This gave him heavy criticism in more recent years. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been a great challenge for any leader, Davis\'s performance in this role is considered poor.<ref name="reassessment"/> After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.<ref name="strawbridge"/>\n\nSome portions of his legacy were created not as memorials, but as contemporary recognition of his service at the time.\n\n[[Fort Davis National Historic Site]] began as a frontier military post in October 1854, in the mountains of western Texas.

The surrounding area was designated [[Jeff Davis County, Texas|Jeff Davis County]] in 1887, with the town of Fort Davis as the county seat.
