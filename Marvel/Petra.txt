The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area\'s mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in [[Rainwater harvesting|harvesting rainwater]], [[agriculture]] and [[stone carving]]. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous [[Al-Khazneh]] structure ‚Äì believed to be the [[mausoleum]] of Nabataean king [[Aretas IV Philopatris|Aretas IV]] ‚Äì was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/01-02/petra/|title=Petra Lost and Found|work=National Geographic|date=2 January 2016|access-date=8 April 2018|archive-date=8 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408210210/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/01-02/petra/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the [[Roman Empire]] in the first century BC, it was only in 106&nbsp;AD that it lost its independence.

In the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]] several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline, and by the early Islamic era it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown until it was rediscovered in 1812 by [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/arts/art-review-rose-red-city-carved-from-the-rock.html|title=ART REVIEW; Rose-Red City Carved From the Rock|first=Grace|last=Glueck|date=17 October 2003|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=29 January 2018|archive-date=28 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228165453/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/arts/art-review-rose-red-city-carved-from-the-rock.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the city is through a {{convert|1.2|km|mi|frac=4|adj=mid|-long}} gorge called the [[Siq]], which leads directly to the Khazneh.

Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a [[perennial stream]], Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in the west, to [[Bosra]] and [[Damascus]] in the north, to [[Aqaba]] and Leuce Come on the [[Red Sea]], and across the desert to the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Description==\n\n===Water control===\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial [[oasis]]. The area is visited by [[flash flood]]s, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of [[dam]]s, [[cistern]]s, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of [[drought]] and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nabataea.net/waterw.html |title=Petra: Water Works |publisher=Nabataea.net |access-date=2011-12-05 |archive-date=2011-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126220840/http://nabataea.net/waterw.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Lisa Pinsker |url=http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/june04/feature_petra.html |title=Geotimes ‚Äì June 2014‚Äì Petra: An Eroding Ancient City |publisher=Agiweb.org |date=2001-09-11 |access-date=2011-12-05 |archive-date=2012-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331130050/http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/june04/feature_petra.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Access routes===\n[[Image:Al-Siq 2.jpg|thumb|left|The narrow passage ([[Siq]]) that leads to Petra]]\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun ("Aaron\'s Mountain"), the location of the [[Tomb of Aaron]], said to be the burial place of [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only {{convert|3|‚Äì|4|m|0|abbr=on}} wide, called the [[Siq]] ("shaft"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the [[sandstone]] rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into [[Wadi Musa]].<ref name="Fulford97">{{cite web |url= http://www.robertfulford.com/petra.html |title= Robert Fulford\'s column about Petra, Jordan |publisher= Robertfulford.com |date= 1997-06-18 |access-date= 2014-02-06 |archive-date= 2015-09-24 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091633/http://www.robertfulford.com/petra.html |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n=== Hellenistic architecture ===\nOne of the main things that Petra is known for is its [[Hellenistic architecture]]. The facades of the tombs in Petra display this type of architecture and it also grants reflection on the different types of cultures that the [[Nabataeans|Nabataens]] traded with. Most of these contain small burials and niches that are carved into the stone.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Petra: Rock-cut fa√ßades (article)|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/west-and-central-asia-apahh/west-asia/a/petra-rock-cut-facades|access-date=2021-12-03|website=Khan Academy|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps a more prominent resemblance to the Hellenistic style comes with its [[Al-Khazneh|Treasury]], which is {{convert|24|meters}} wide and {{convert|37|meters}} tall and gives reference to the architecture of Alexandria.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alexandria {{!}} History, Population, Map, & Facts {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Alexandria-Egypt|access-date=2021-12-03|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref> The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central [[Tholos (architecture)|tholos]] inside, and two [[obelisk]]s appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury there are twin Greek gods [[Castor and Pollux]], who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, [[Isis]] being the Egyptian goddess and [[Tyche]] being the Greek goddess of good fortune.<ref name=":3" />\n\nAnother prime example of the Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is in its [[Ad Deir|Monastery]], which stands at {{convert|45|meters}} tall and {{convert|50|meters}} wide, this is Petra\'s largest monument and is another building carved into the rocks of Petra. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the [[Al-Khazneh|Treasury]], as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture.<ref name=":3" /> Its only source of light is its entrance standing at {{convert|8|meters}} high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], this was a place for [[Christians|Christian]] worship, but is now is a holy site for [[pilgrim]]s to visit.\n\n===City centre===\n[[File:Amphitheatre, Petra, Jordan1.jpg|thumb|left|The Theatre]]\nAt the end of the narrow gorge, the [[Siq]], stands Petra\'s most elaborate ruin, popularly known as [[Al-Khazneh]] ("the Treasury"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.<ref name="Fulford97"/> A little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called \'\'en-Nejr\'\', is a massive [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], positioned so as to bring the greatest number of [[tomb]]s within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.<ref name=EB1911/> The theatre  was said to hold around 8,500 people.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=Theatre {{!}} Jordan Attractions|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jordan/the-ancient-city/attractions/theatre/a/poi-sig/1446303/1332397|access-date=2021-12-03|website=Lonely Planet|language=en}}</ref> The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. [[Gladiator]] fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the [[363 Galilee earthquake]].<ref name=":4" />\n\nThe [[Petra Pool and Garden Complex]] is a series of structures within the city center.

This street used to hold a semi-circle [[nymphaeum]], which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra\'s only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Ancient City of Petra|url=https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/archaeology/the-ancient-city-of-petra2|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== The High Place of Sacrifice ===\nThe High Place of Sacrifice is located at the top of Jebel Madbah Mountain.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-01-03|title=The High Place of Sacrifice|url=https://www.touristjordan.com/high-place-sacrifice/|access-date=2021-12-03|website=Tourist Jordan|language=en-US}}</ref> The beginning of the hike is near Petra\'s famous theatre. From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was [[libation]]. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the [[Tomb of Aaron (Jordan)|Prophet Aaron]] is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the smoking of [[frankincense]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Petra|url=https://www.memphistours.com/Jordan/Jordan-Travel-Guide/Petra-Attractions/wiki/Petra|access-date=2021-12-03|website=www.memphistours.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Royal Tombs ===\n[[File:Palace Tomb, Petra.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace Tomb]]]]\nThe Royal Tombs of Petra embody the unique artistry of the Nabateans while also giving display to Hellenistic architecture, but the fa√ßades of these tombs have worn due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the [[Palace Tomb]], is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the [[Al-Khazneh|Treasury]]. The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb.

It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about {{cvt|0.5|mi|1}} south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, {{cvt|184|by|161|ft}} platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, {{cvt|28|by|28|ft}}, which was facing east toward the staircase.

It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of [[Alexander Severus]], when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo-[[Iran|Persian]] power under the [[Sassanid Empire]].<ref name= EB1911/>\n\nMeanwhile, as [[Palmyra]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 130‚Äì270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious centre. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c.315‚Äì403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honour of the virgin [[Khaabou]] (Chaabou) and her offspring [[Dushara]].<ref name= EB1911/> Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the main deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.<ref>{{cite book| title= The Religious Life of Nabataea| chapter= Chapter 2| year= 2013| first= Peter| last= Alpass}}</ref>\n\nBetween 111 and 114 [[Trajan]] built the [[Via Traiana Nova]], running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the \'\'[[Pax Romana]]\'\', this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor [[Hadrian]]\'s administrators left marks{{dubious|Meaning what?|date=December 2019}} in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the [[Dead Sea]]. In 130 AD, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of \'\'HadriƒÅnƒ´ Petra Metropolis\'\', imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in [[Jerash]]. The province\'s governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental [[mausoleum]] for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King\'s Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\n\nThe interest that Roman emperors showed for the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to [[Liber Pater]], a god revered by Emperor [[Septimius Severus]], was found in the \'\'[[temenos]]\'\' of the temple known as [[Qasr al-Bint]], and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor\'s portrait, as well as pottery from his reign.

There is continuing debate about the nature of Qos (qaus ‚Äì bow) who has been identified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele is also a bow.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nNabataean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, [[Baal]] and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-\'allahi ‚Äì god decided (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi ‚Äì "gods covenant" (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi "Allah is peace" and Shalm-allat, "the peace of the goddess". We also find Amat-allahi "she-servant of god" and Halaf-llahi "the successor of Allah".<ref>Negev 11</ref>\n\nRecently, Petra has been put forward as the original "Mecca" by some in the [[revisionist school of Islamic studies]], owing to claims of large numbers of independent pieces of evidence,{{Citation needed|date=March 2021|reason=No citation given for "large numbers of independent pieces of evidence".}} namely that the early original mosques faced Petra, not [[Jerusalem]] or [[Mecca]], as the direction of Muslim prayer, the [[Qibla]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Dan |title=Early Islamic Qiblas: A survey of mosques built between 1AH/622 C.E. and 263 AH/876 C.E. |isbn=978-1927581223|year=2017 }}</ref> However, others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques‚Äô Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.<ref>{{cite book |last1=King |first1=David A. |title=The Petra Fallacy |url=https://www.academia.edu/37957366 |access-date=2019-09-15 |archive-date=2020-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208122256/https://www.academia.edu/37957366/KING_2018_The_Petra_fallacy_Early_mosques_do_face_the_Sacred_Kaaba_in_Mecca_but_Dan_Gibson_doesnt_know_how |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Monastery, Petra, Jordan8.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ad Deir]] ("The Monastery")]]\n[[Ad Deir|The Monastery]], Petra\'s largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC.

The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian Emperor of Rome took over, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], otherwise known as Constantine The Great. He began the initial spread of Christianity throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] mentions a bishop of Petra (Anhioch. 10) named [[Asterius of Petra|Asterius]]. At least one of the tombs (the "tomb with the urn"?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration "in the time of the most holy bishop Jason" (447). After the [[Islam]]ic conquest of 629‚Äì632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam. During the [[First Crusade]] Petra was occupied by [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and formed the second [[fief]] of the [[feudal barony|barony]] of [[Al Karak]] (in the lordship of [[Oultrejordain]]) with the title \'\'Ch√¢teau de la Val√©e de Moyse\'\' or Sela.
