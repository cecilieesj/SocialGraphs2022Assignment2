Shotguns are most commonly [[smoothbore]] firearms, meaning that their [[gun barrel]]s have no [[rifling]] on the inner wall, but rifled barrels for shooting slugs ([[slug barrel]]s) are also available.\n\nShotguns come in a wide variety of [[caliber]]s and [[Gauge (firearms)|gauges]] ranging from 5.5&nbsp;mm (.22&nbsp;inch) to up to {{cvt|5|cm|in}}, though the [[12-gauge]] (18.53&nbsp;mm or 0.729&nbsp;in) and [[20-gauge]] (15.63&nbsp;mm or 0.615&nbsp;in) bores are by far the most common. Almost all are [[breechloading]], and can be single-barreled, [[double barreled shotgun|double-barreled]], or in the form of a [[combination gun]]. Like rifles, shotguns also come in a range of different [[action (firearms)|action]] types, both [[single-shot]] and [[repeating firearm|repeating]]. For non-repeating designs, [[double-barreled shotgun|over-and-under]] and [[double-barreled shotgun|side-by-side]] [[break action]] shotguns are by far the most common variants. Although [[revolver#Shotguns|revolving shotgun]]s did exist, most modern repeating shotguns are either [[pump-action shotgun|pump-action]] or [[semi-automatic shotgun|semi-automatic]], and also [[automatic shotgun|fully automatic]], [[lever action#Lever-action shotguns|lever-action]] or [[bolt-action]] to a lesser extent.\n\nPreceding smoothbore firearms (such as the [[musket]]) were widely used by armies in the 18th century. The [[muzzleloader|muzzleloading]] [[blunderbuss]], the direct ancestor of the shotgun, was also used in similar roles from self-defense to riot control. Shotguns were often favored by [[cavalry]] troops in the early to mid-19th century because of its ease of use and generally good effectiveness on the move, as well as by coachmen for its substantial power. But by the late 19th century, these weapons became largely replaced on the battlefield by [[breechloading]] rifled firearms shooting spin-stabilized [[cylindro-conoidal bullet]]s, which were far more accurate with longer [[effective range]]s. The military value of shotguns was rediscovered in the [[First World War]], when [[American Expeditionary Force|American]] forces used the pump-action [[Winchester Model 1897]]s in [[trench warfare|trench fighting]] to great effect. Since then, shotguns have been used in a variety of [[close quarters combat|close-quarter]] roles in civilian, law enforcement and military applications.\n\nThe smoothbore shotgun barrel generates less [[friction|resistance]] and thus allows greater [[propellant]] loads for heavier projectiles without as much risk of [[proof test#Firearms|overpressure]] or a [[squib load]], and are also easier to [[firearm maintenance|clean]]. The shot pellets from a shotshell are propelled indirectly through a [[wadding]] inside the shell and scatter upon leaving the barrel, which is usually [[choke (firearms)|choke]]d at the muzzle end to control the projectile scatter. This means each shotgun discharge will produce a [[shot grouping|cluster of impact points]] instead of a single point of impact like other firearms. Having multiple projectiles also means the [[muzzle energy]] is divided among the pellets, leaving each individual projectile with less [[penetration (weaponry)|penetrative]] [[kinetic energy]]. The lack of spin stabilization and the generally suboptimal [[aerodynamic]] shape of the shot pellets also make them less accurate and decelerate quite quickly in flight due to [[drag (physics)|drag]], giving shotguns short [[effective range]]s. In a hunting context, this makes shotguns useful primarily for hunting fast-flying birds and other agile small/medium-sized [[game (food)|game]] without risking [[overpenetration]] and [[stray bullet|stray shot]]s to distant bystander and objects. However, in a military or law enforcement context, the high short-range blunt [[stopping power|knockback force]] and large number of projectiles makes the shotgun useful as a [[door breaching]] tool, a [[riot control|crowd control]] or [[close combat|close-quarters]] [[defensive weapon]]. Militants or insurgents may use shotguns in [[asymmetric engagement]]s, as shotguns are commonly owned civilian weapons in many countries. Shotguns are also used for [[shooting target|target]]-[[shooting sport]]s such as [[skeet shooting|skeet]], [[trap shooting|trap]] and [[sporting clays]], which involve flying [[clay]] disks, known as "[[clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeons]]", thrown in various ways by a dedicated launching device called a "trap".\n\n==Characteristics==\nShotguns come in a wide variety of forms, from very small up to massive [[punt gun]]s, and in nearly every type of firearm operating mechanism. The common characteristics that make a shotgun unique center on the requirements of a firing shot. These features are the features typical of a [[shotgun shell]], namely a relatively short, wide cartridge, with straight walls, and operating at a relatively low pressure.\n\nAmmunition for shotguns is referred to in the United States as shotgun shells, shotshells, or shells (when it is not likely to be confused with [[artillery shell]]s). The term [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] is standard usage in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe shot is usually fired from a smoothbore barrel; another configuration is the rifled [[slug barrel]], which fires more accurate solitary projectiles.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Shotgun-shot-sequence-1g.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Series of individual 1/1,000,000-second exposures showing shotgun firing shot and [[wadding]] separation]]\n\nThe typical use of a shotgun is against small and fast moving targets, often while in the air. The spreading of the shot allows the user to point the shotgun close to the target, rather than having to aim precisely as in the case of a single projectile. The disadvantages of shot are limited range and limited penetration of the shot, which is why shotguns are used at short ranges, and typically against smaller targets. Larger shot sizes, up to the extreme case of the single projectile slug load, result in increased penetration, but at the expense of fewer projectiles and lower probability of hitting the target.\n\nAside from the most common use against small, fast moving targets, the shotgun has several advantages when used against still targets. First, it has enormous [[stopping power]] at short range, more than nearly all handguns and many rifles. Though many believe the shotgun is a great firearm for inexperienced shooters, the truth is, at close range, the spread of shot is not very large at all, and competency in aiming is still required. A typical self-defense load of [[buckshot]] contains 8–27 large lead pellets, resulting in many wound tracks in the target. Also, unlike a [[full metal jacket bullet|fully jacketed]] rifle bullet, each pellet of shot is less likely to penetrate walls and hit bystanders (though in the case of traditional 00-Buck, overpenetration of soft and hard targets may be an issue).<ref name="theboxotruth.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/bot3_2.htm|title=The Box O\' Truth #3 – The Shotgun Meets the Box O\' Truth The Box O\' Truth|work=The Box O\' Truth|access-date=3 October 2014|date=13 June 2014}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=January 2015|certain=y}} It is favored by [[Police|law enforcement]] for its low penetration and high stopping power.\n\nOn the other hand, the hit potential of a defensive shotgun is often overstated. The typical [[self-defense|defensive]] shot is taken at very close ranges, at which the shot charge expands no more than a few centimeters.<ref name="theboxotruth.com"/> This means the shotgun must still be aimed at the target with some care. Balancing this is the fact that shot spreads further upon entering the target, and the multiple wound channels are far more likely to produce a disabling wound than a rifle or handgun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firearmstactical.com/briefs10.htm |title=Shotgun Home Defense Ammunition, .357 SIG – A Solution in Search of a Problem? |publisher=Firearmstactical.com |access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Sporting===\n[[File:Vincent Hancock at 2008 Summer Olympics men\'s skeet finals 2008-08-16.JPG|thumb|[[Vincent Hancock]] in the men\'s [[Olympic skeet|skeet]] finals at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]\nSome of the most common uses of shotguns are the sports of [[skeet shooting]], [[trap shooting]], and [[Sporting Clays (shooting)|sporting clays]]. These involve shooting clay discs, also known as clay pigeons, thrown in by hand and by machine. Both skeet and trap competitions are featured at the [[Olympic Games]].\n\n===Hunting===\nThe shotgun is popular for bird [[hunting]] (called "game-shooting" in the UK, where "hunting" refers to hunting mammals with a pack of hounds), it is also used for more general forms of hunting especially in semi-populated areas where the range of rifle bullets may pose a hazard. Use of a [[smoothbore]] shotgun with a rifled slug or, alternatively, a rifled barrel shotgun with a [[sabot (firearms)|sabot]] slug, improves accuracy to {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} or more. This is well within the range of the majority of kill shots by experienced hunters using shotguns.\n\nHowever, given the relatively low muzzle velocity of slug ammunition, typically around 500&nbsp;m/s (about 1600 feet per second), and the blunt, poorly streamlined shape of typical slugs (which cause them to lose velocity very rapidly, compared to rifle bullets), a hunter must pay close attention to the [[ballistics]] of the particular ammunition used to ensure an effective and humane kill shot.\n\nAt any reasonable range, shotgun slugs make effective lethal wounds due to their tremendous mass, reducing the length of time that an animal might suffer. For example, a typical 12-gauge shotgun slug is a blunt piece of metal that could be described as an 18&nbsp;mm (.729&nbsp;inch) caliber that weighs 28&nbsp;grams (432 grains). For comparison, a common deer-hunting rifle round is a 7.62&nbsp;mm (.308&nbsp;inch) slug weighing 9.7&nbsp;grams (150 grains), but the dynamics of the rifle cartridge allow for a different type of wound, and a much further reach.\n\nShotguns are often used with rifled barrels in locations where it is not lawful to hunt with a rifle. Typically, a sabot slug is used in these barrels for maximum accuracy and performance. Shotguns are often used to hunt whitetail deer in the thick brush and briers of the Southeastern and upper Midwestern United States, where, due to the dense cover, ranges tend to be close – 25m or less.\n\nSabot slugs are essentially very large hollow point bullets, and are streamlined for maximum spin and accuracy when shot through a rifled barrel. They have greater ranges than older Foster and Brenneke-type slugs.\n\nPeople often use semiautomatic or pump-action shotguns for hunting waterfowl to small game.\n\n[[File:Gurkha IOC 1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A [[Gurkha Contingent]] trooper in Singapore armed with a folding stock pump shotgun]]\n\n===Law enforcement===\nIn the US and Canada, shotguns are widely used as a support weapon by police forces. One of the rationales for issuing shotguns is that, even without much training, an officer will probably be able to hit targets at close to intermediate range, due to the "spreading" effect of buckshot.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} This is largely a myth, as the spread of buckshot at 25 feet averages 8 inches,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} which is still very capable of missing a target.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Some police forces are replacing shotguns in this role with carbine rifles such as [[AR-15]]s. Shotguns are also used in [[roadblock]] situations, where police are blocking a highway to search cars for suspects. In the US, law enforcement agencies often use [[riot shotgun]]s, especially for crowd and riot control where they may be loaded with [[Less-lethal weapons|less-lethal]] rounds such as [[rubber bullets]] or [[flexible baton round|bean bags]]. Shotguns are also often used as [[Door breaching#Ballistic|breaching]] devices to defeat locks.\n\n===Military===\n{{See also|Combat shotgun}}\nShotguns are common weapons in military use, particularly for special purposes. Shotguns are found aboard naval vessels for shipboard security, because the weapon is very effective at close range as a way of repelling enemy [[Boarding (attack)|boarding parties]]. In a naval setting, [[stainless steel]] shotguns are often used, because regular steel is more prone to corrosion in the marine environment. Shotguns are also used by [[military police]] units. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] have used shotguns since their inception at the [[squad]] level, often in the hands of [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]], while the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] often issued them to a squad\'s [[point man]]. Shotguns were modified for and used in the [[trench warfare]] of [[WWI]], in the [[Jungle warfare|jungle combat]] of [[WWII]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Shotguns were also used in the [[Iraq War]], being popular with soldiers in [[Urban warfare|urban combat]] environments. Some U.S. units in Iraq used shotguns with special [[frangible]] [[breaching round]]s to blow the locks off doors when making a surprise entry into a dwelling.\n\n===Home and personal defense===\nShotguns are a popular means of home defense for many of the same reasons they are preferred for close-quarters tasks in law enforcement and the military.\n\n==Design features for various uses==\nCompared to handguns, shotguns are heavier, larger, and not as maneuverable in close quarters (which also presents a greater retention problem), but do have these advantages:\n* They are generally much more powerful.\n* The average shooter can engage multiple targets faster than with a handgun.\n* They are generally perceived as more intimidating.\n* On average, a quality pump-action shotgun is generally less expensive than a quality handgun (self-loading shotguns are generally more expensive than their pump-action counterparts).\n* When loaded with smaller shot, a shotgun will not penetrate walls as readily as rifle and pistol rounds, making it safer for non-combatants when fired in or around populated structures. This comes at a price, however, as smaller shot may not penetrate deeply enough to cause an immediately incapacitating wound; those who recommend birdshot for minimizing wall penetration also suggest backing it up with a larger buckshot if the first shot fails to stop the threat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firearmstactical.com/briefs10.htm |title=Shotgun Home Defense Ammunition |publisher=Firearms Tactical Institute|access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Shotgun in training US military.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[United States Marine Corps|American marine]] fires a [[Benelli M4]] shotgun during training in Arta, [[Djibouti]], 23 December 2006]]\nThe wide range of forms the shotgun can take leads to some significant differences between what is technically a shotgun and what is legally considered a shotgun. A fairly broad attempt to define a shotgun is made in the [[United States Code]] (18 USC 921), which defines the shotgun as "a weapon designed or redesigned, made or remade, and intended to be fired from the shoulder, and designed or redesigned and made or remade to use the energy of the explosive in a fixed shotgun shell to fire through a [[smoothbore]] either a number of ball shot or a single projectile for each single pull of the trigger." It is even more broadly defined in English law: "a smooth bore gun not being an air gun" (s.1(3)(a) Firearms Act 1968).\n\nA rifled [[slug (projectile)|slug]], with finned rifling designed to enable the projectile to be safely fired through a [[Choke (firearms)|choked]] barrel, is an example of a single projectile. Some shotguns have rifled barrels and are designed to be used with a "saboted" bullet, one which is typically encased in a two-piece plastic ring (\'\'sabot\'\') designed to peel away after it exits the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], leaving the bullet, now spinning after passing through the rifled barrel, to continue toward the target. These shotguns, although they have rifled barrels, still use a shotgun-style shell instead of a rifle [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] and may in fact still fire regular multipellet shotgun shells, but the rifling in the barrel will affect the shot pattern. The use of a rifled barrel blurs the distinction between rifle and shotgun. Hunting laws may differentiate between smooth barreled and rifled barreled guns.\n\n\'\'\'[[Combat shotgun]]\'\'\' is a shotgun designed for offensive purposes, typically for the military.\n\n\'\'\'[[Riot shotgun]]\'\'\' has long been a [[synonym]] for a shotgun, especially a short-barrelled shotgun. During the 19th and early 20th century, these were used to disperse protesters, rioters and revolutionaries. The wide spray of the [[Shot sizes|shot]] ensured a large group would be hit, but the light shot would ensure more wounds than fatalities. When the ground was paved, police officers would often [[ricochet]] the shot off the ground, slowing down the shot and spreading pattern even further. To this day specialized police and defensive shotguns are called [[riot shotgun]]s. The introduction of [[rubber bullets]] and [[flexible baton round|bean bag]] rounds ended the practice of using shot for the most part, but riot shotguns are still used to fire a variety of [[less-lethal]] rounds for [[riot control]].\n\nA \'\'\'[[sawed-off shotgun]]\'\'\' (or "sawn-off") refers to a shotgun whose barrel has been shortened, leaving it more maneuverable, easier to use at short range and more readily concealed. Many countries establish a legal minimum barrel length that precludes easy concealment (this length is {{convert|18|in|mm}} in the U.S. and 24 inches in the UK). The sawed-off shotgun is sometimes known as a "[[lupara]]" (in Italian a generic reference to the word "\'\'lupo\'\'" ("wolf")) in Southern Italy and [[Sicily]].\n\n\'\'\'[[Coach gun]]s\'\'\' are similar to sawn-off shotguns, except they are manufactured with a 46&nbsp;cm (18") barrel and are legal for civilian ownership in some jurisdictions. Coach guns are also more commonly associated with the American Old West or Australian Colonial period, and often used for hunting in bush, scrub, or marshland where a longer barrel would be unwieldy or impractical.\n\n\'\'\'[[Snake Charmer (shotgun)|Snake Charmer shotguns]]\'\'\' are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest control. They have short barrels and either a full-size stocks or pistol grips, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with some measuring up at less than {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}}. These weapons are typically single-shot break-action .410 "gauge" (caliber), which may or may not hold extra shot-shells in the butt-stock. They typically have a cylinder bore and sometimes are available in modified choke as well. Snake Charmers are popular for "home defense" purposes and as "survival" weapons.\n\nOther examples include a variety of .410 / rifle "survival" guns manufactured in over/under designs. In the [[combination gun]] arrangement, a rimfire or centrefire rifle barrel is located beneath the barrel of a .410 gauge shotgun. Generally, there is one manually cocked external hammer and an external selection lever to select which caliber of cartridge to fire. A notable example is the [[Springfield Armory M6 Scout]], a .410 / .22 issued to United States Air Force personnel as a "survival" gun in the event of a forced landing or accident in a wilderness area. Variants have been used by Israeli, Canadian, and American armed forces. Shotgun-rifle [[combination gun]]s with two, three, and occasionally even four barrels are available from a number of makers, primarily European. These provided flexibility, enabling the hunter to effectively shoot at flushing birds or more distant small mammals while only carrying one gun.\n\n==History==\n[[File:confederateshotgun.jpg|right|thumb|[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cavalryman]]\nMost early firearms, such as the [[blunderbuss]], [[arquebus]], and [[musket]] had large diameter, smoothbore barrels, and could fire shot as well as solid balls. A firearm intended for use in wing shooting of birds was known as a \'\'\'fowling piece\'\'\'. The 1728 [[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|\'\'Cyclopaedia\'\']] defines a \'\'fowling piece\'\' as:\n\n:\'\'Fowling Piece, a portable Fire Arm for the shooting of Birds. See Fire Arm.\'\'\n:\'\'Of Fowling Pieces, those are reputed the best, which have the longest Barrel, vis. from 5{{frac|1|2}} foot to 6; with an indifferent Bore, under Harquebus: Tho\' for different Occasions they shou\'d be of different Sorts, and Sizes. But in all, \'tis essential the Barrel be well polish\'d and smooth within; and the Bore all of a Bigness, from one End to another...\'\'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900240835&isize=M |title=Problem while searching in History of Science |publisher=Digicoll.library.wisc.edu |access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]], in service with the British army from 1722 to 1838, had a 19&nbsp;mm (.75&nbsp;inch) smoothbore barrel, roughly the same as a 10-gauge shotgun, and was {{convert|157|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, just short of the above recommended 168&nbsp;cm (5{{frac|1|2}} feet). On the other hand, records from the [[Plymouth colony]] show a maximum length of 137&nbsp;cm (4{{frac|1|2}} feet) for fowling pieces,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plymoutharch.tripod.com/id71.html|title=Firearms in Plymouth Colony|publisher=Plymoutharch.tripod.com|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> shorter than the typical musket.\n\nShot was also used in warfare; the [[buck and ball]] loading, combining a musket ball with three or six buckshot, was used throughout the history of the smoothbore musket. The first recorded use of the term \'\'shotgun\'\' was in 1776 in [[Kentucky]]. It was noted as part of the "frontier language of the West" by [[James Fenimore Cooper]].\n\nWith the adoption of smaller bores and rifled barrels, the shotgun began to emerge as a separate entity. Shotguns have long been the preferred method for sport hunting of birds, and the largest shotguns, the [[punt gun]]s, were used for commercial hunting. The [[double-barreled shotgun]] has changed little since the development of the [[Anson & Deeley boxlock action|boxlock]] action in 1875. Modern innovations such as interchangeable chokes and subgauge inserts make the double-barreled shotgun the shotgun of choice in [[Skeet shooting|skeet]], [[trap shooting]], and [[sporting clays]], as well as with many hunters.\n\nAs wing shooting has been a prestige sport, specialty gunsmiths such as [[Krieghoff]] or [[Perazzi]] have produced fancy double-barrel guns for wealthy European and American hunters. These weapons can cost US$5,000 or more; some elaborately decorated presentation guns have sold for up to US$100,000.<ref>Fjestad, S. P. \'\'Blue Book of Gun Values\'\', 13th Ed.</ref>\n\nDuring its long history, the shotgun has been favored by bird hunters, guards, and [[Police|law enforcement officials]]. The shotgun has fallen in and out of favor with military forces several times in its long history. Shotguns and similar weapons are simpler than long-range rifles, and were developed earlier. The development of more accurate and deadlier long-range rifles minimized the usefulness of the shotgun on the open battlefields of European wars. But armies have "rediscovered" the shotgun for specialty uses many times.\n\n===19th century===\nDuring the 19th century, shotguns were mainly employed by [[cavalry]] units. Both sides of the [[American Civil War]] employed shotguns. U.S. cavalry used the shotgun extensively during the [[Indian Wars]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Mounted units favored the shotgun for its moving target effectiveness, and devastating close-range firepower. The shotgun was also favored by citizen militias and similar groups.\n\nWith the exception of cavalry units, the shotgun saw less and less use throughout the 19th century on the battlefield. As a defense weapon it remained popular with guards and lawmen, however, and the shotgun became one of many symbols of the [[American Old West]]. Lawman [[Cody Lyons]] killed two men with a shotgun; his friend [[Doc Holliday]]\'s only confirmed kill was with a shotgun. The weapon both these men used was the short-barreled version favored by private strongbox guards on stages and trains. These guards, called express messengers, became known as [[shotgun messenger]]s, since they rode with the weapon (loaded with buckshot) for defense against bandits. Passenger carriages carrying a strongbox usually had at least one private guard armed with a shotgun riding in front of the coach, next to the driver. This practice has survived in American slang; the term [[Calling shotgun|"riding shotgun"]] is used for the passenger who sits in the front passenger seat. The shotgun was a popular weapon for personal protection in the [[American Old West]], requiring less skill on the part of the user than a [[revolver]].\n\n===Hammerless shotguns===\nThe origins of the hammerless shotgun are European but otherwise obscure. The earliest breechloading shotguns originated in France and Belgium in the early 19th century (see also the history of the [[Pinfire]]) and a number of them such as those by Robert and Chateauvillard from the 1830s and 1840s did not use hammers. In fact during these decades a wide variety of ingenious weapons, including rifles, adopted what is now often known as a \'needle-fire\' method of igniting the charge, where a firing pin or a longer sharper needle provided the necessary impact. The most widely used British hammerless needle-fire shotgun was the unusual hinged-chamber fixed-barrel breech-loader by Joseph Needham, produced from the 1850s. By the 1860s hammerless guns were increasingly used in Europe both in war and sport although hammer guns were still very much in the majority. The first significant encroachment on hammer guns was a hammerless patent which could be used with a conventional side-lock. This was British gunmaker T. Murcott\'s 1871 action nicknamed the \'mousetrap\' on account of its loud snap action. However, the most successful hammerless innovation of the 1870s was Anson and Deeley\'s [[boxlock action|boxlock]] patent of 1875. This simple but ingenious design only used four moving parts allowing the production of cheaper and reliable shotguns.\n\n[[Daniel Myron LeFever]] is credited with the invention of the American hammerless shotgun. Working for Barber & LeFever in Syracuse, New York, he introduced his first hammerless shotgun in 1878. This gun was cocked with external cocking levers on the side of the breech. He went on to patent the first truly automatic hammerless shotgun in 1883. This gun automatically cocked itself when the breech was closed. He later developed the mechanism to automatically eject the shells when the breech was opened.\n\n===John Moses Browning===\nOne of the men most responsible for the modern development of the shotgun was prolific gun designer [[John Browning]]. While working for [[Winchester Firearms]], Browning revolutionized shotgun design. In 1887, Browning introduced the [[Winchester Model 1887/1901|Model 1887 Lever Action Repeating Shotgun]], which loaded a fresh cartridge from its internal magazine by the operation of the action lever. Before this time most shotguns were the \'[[break open]]\' type.\n\nThis development was greatly overshadowed by two further innovations he introduced at the end of the 19th century. In 1893, Browning produced the Model 1893 Pump Action Shotgun, introducing the now familiar pump action to the market. And in 1900, he patented the [[Browning Auto-5]], America\'s first semi-automatic shotgun. The first semi-automatic shotgun in the world was patented in 1891–1893 by the Clair brothers of France.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm%3Fidarticles%3D1822 |title=Automatic Weapons:French Forerunners |access-date=28 December 2021 |archive-date=22 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211222152208/http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=1822 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Browning Auto-5 remained in production until 1998.\n\n===World wars===\nThe decline in military use of shotguns reversed in [[World War I]]. American forces under [[General Pershing]] employed 12-gauge pump-action shotguns when they were deployed to the Western Front in 1917. These shotguns were fitted with [[bayonets]] and a heat shield so the barrel could be gripped while the bayonet was deployed. Shotguns fitted in this fashion became known as \'\'[[combat shotgun|trench guns]]\'\' by the [[United States Army]]. Those without such modifications were known as \'\'riot guns\'\'. After World War I, the United States military began referring to all shotguns as \'\'riot guns\'\'.\n\nDue to the cramped conditions of [[trench warfare]], the American shotguns were extremely effective. [[German Empire|Germany]] even filed an official diplomatic protest against their use, alleging they violated the [[laws of warfare]]. The [[United States Army Judge Advocate General\'s Corps|judge advocate general]] reviewed the protest, and it was rejected because the Germans protested use of lead shot (which would have been illegal) but military shot was plated. This is the only occasion the legality of the shotgun\'s use in warfare has been questioned.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bruce N. Canfield |date=May 2004 | title = Give Us More Shotguns! | journal = American Rifleman }}</ref>\n\n[[File:ww2marineshotgun.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] carrying a [[Winchester Model 1897|Winchester M97]] shotgun during [[World War II]]]]\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the shotgun was not heavily used in the war in Europe by official military forces. However, the shotgun was a favorite weapon of Allied-supported [[Partisan (military)|partisans]], such as the [[French Resistance]]. By contrast, in the Pacific theater, thick jungles and heavily fortified positions made the shotgun a favorite weapon of the [[United States Marines]]. Marines tended to use pump shotguns, since the pump action was less likely to jam in the humid and dirty conditions of the Pacific campaign. Similarly, the [[United States Navy]] used pump shotguns to guard ships when in port in Chinese harbors (e.g., Shanghai). The [[United States Army Air Forces]] also used pump shotguns to guard bombers and other aircraft against saboteurs when parked on airbases across the Pacific and on the West Coast of the United States. Pump and semi-automatic shotguns were used in marksmanship training, particularly for bomber gunners. The most common pump shotguns used for these duties were the 12-gauge [[Winchester Model 1897|Winchester Model 97]] and [[Winchester Model 1912|Model 12]]. The break-open action, single barrel shotgun was used by the British [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] and U.S. home security forces. Notably, industrial centers (such as the Gopher State Steel Works) were guarded by National Guard soldiers with [[Winchester Model 37]] 12-gauge shotguns.\n\n===Late 20th century to present===\nSince the end of World War II, the shotgun has remained a specialty weapon for modern armies. It has been deployed for specialized tasks where its strengths were put to particularly good use. It was used to defend machine gun emplacements during the [[Korean War]], American and French jungle patrols used shotguns during the [[Vietnam War]], and shotguns saw extensive use as door breaching and close quarter weapons in the early stages of the [[Iraq War]], and saw limited use in tank crews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensetech.org/archives/001951.html |title=SMALL ARMS IN IRAQ: WHAT WORKED, WHAT SUCKED WHAT A HOAX |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410014702/http://www.defensetech.org/archives/001951.html |archive-date=10 April 2009}}</ref> Many modern [[Navy|navies]] make extensive use of shotguns by personnel engaged in boarding hostile ships, as any shots fired will almost certainly be over a short range. Nonetheless, shotguns are far less common in military use than rifles, carbines, submachineguns, or pistols.\n\nOn the other hand, the shotgun has become a standard in law enforcement use. A variety of specialty less-lethal or non-lethal ammunitions, such as tear gas shells, bean bags, flares, explosive sonic stun rounds, and rubber projectiles, all packaged into 12-gauge shotgun shells, are produced specifically for the law enforcement market. Recently, [[Taser International]] introduced a self-contained electronic weapon which is fired from a standard 12-gauge shotgun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taser.com/products/law/Pages/XREP.aspx |title=Taser Xrep |publisher=Taser.com |access-date=5 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903132852/http://www.taser.com/PRODUCTS/LAW/Pages/XREP.aspx |archive-date=3 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe shotgun remains a standard firearm for hunting throughout the world for all sorts of game from birds and small game to large game such as deer. The versatility of the shotgun as a hunting weapon has steadily increased as slug rounds and more advanced rifled barrels have given shotguns longer range and higher killing power. The shotgun has become a ubiquitous firearm in the hunting community.\n\n==Design factors==\n\n===Action===\nThe [[action (firearms)|action]] is the operating mechanism of a gun. There are many types of shotguns, typically categorized by the number of [[gun barrel|barrel]]s or the way the gun is reloaded.\n\n====Break-action====\n[[File:ShotgunAction.JPG|thumb|150px|A view of the [[break-action]] of a typical double-barrelled shotgun, shown with the action open]]\n{{Main|Double-barreled shotgun}}\nFor most of the history of the shotgun, the breechloading [[break-action]] shotgun was the most common type, and double-barreled variants are by far the most commonly seen in modern days. These are typically divided into two subtypes: the traditional "side-by-side" shotgun features two barrels mounted horizontally beside each other (as the name suggests), whereas the "over-and-under" shotgun has the two barrels mounted vertically one on top of the other. Side-by-side shotguns were traditionally used for hunting and other sporting pursuits (early long-barreled side-by-side shotguns were known as "fowling pieces" for their use hunting ducks and other [[waterbird]]s as well as some [[landfowl]]s), whereas over-and-under shotguns are more commonly associated with recreational use (such as [[clay pigeon shooting]]). Both types of double-barrel shotgun are used for hunting and sporting use, with the individual configuration largely being a matter of personal preference.\n\nAnother, less commonly encountered type of break-action shotgun is the [[combination gun]], which is an over-and-under design with one smoothbore barrel and one rifle barrel (more often rifle on top, but rifle on bottom was not uncommon). There is also a class of break-action guns called \'\'[[drilling (firearm)|drillings]]\'\', which contain three barrels, usually two smoothbore barrels of the same gauge and a rifled barrel, though the only common theme is that at least one barrel be smoothbore. The most common arrangement was essentially a side-by-side shotgun with the rifled barrel below and centered. Usually a drilling containing more than one rifled barrel would have both rifled barrels in the same [[caliber]], but examples do exist with different caliber barrels, usually a [[.22 long rifle]] and a [[centerfire]] cartridge. Although very rare, drillings with three and even four (a \'\'vierling\'\') shotgun barrels were made.\n\n====Pump-action====\n[[File:Winchester 1897.jpg|thumb|left|400px|A [[Winchester M1897]], one of the first successful pump-action shotgun designs]]\nIn [[pump-action shotgun]]s, a linearly sliding [[forearm (firearm component)|fore-end]] [[handguard]] (i.e. \'\'pump\'\') is manually moved back-and-forth like a [[bicycle pump#Hand pump|hand pump]] to work the action, extracting the spent shell and inserting a new round, while cocking the [[hammer (firearms)|hammer]] or [[firing pin|striker]]. A pump gun is typically fed from a [[tubular magazine]] underneath the barrel, which also serves as a [[guide rail]] for the pump. The rounds are fed in one by one through a port in the receiver, where they are lifted by a lever called the \'\'elevator\'\' and pushed forward into the chamber by the bolt. A pair of latches at the rear of the magazine hold the rounds in place and facilitate feeding of one shell at a time. If it is desired to load the gun fully, a round may be loaded through the ejection port directly into the chamber, or cycled from the magazine, which is then topped off with another round. Well-known examples include the [[Winchester Model 1897]], [[Remington 870]] and [[Mossberg 500]]/590.\n\nPump-action shotguns are common hunting, fowling and sporting shotguns. Hunting models generally have a barrel between 600 and 700&nbsp;mm (24"-28"). Tube-fed models designed for hunting often come with a dowel rod or other stop that is inserted into the magazine and reduces the capacity of the gun to three shells (two in the magazine and one chambered) as is mandated by U.S. federal law when hunting migratory birds. They can also easily be used with an empty magazine as a single-shot weapon, by simply dropping the next round to be fired into the open ejection port after the spent round is ejected. For this reason, pump-actions are commonly used to teach novice shooters under supervision, as the trainer can load each round more quickly than with a break-action, while unlike a break-action the student can maintain his grip on the gun and concentrate on proper handling and firing of the weapon.\n\nPump-action shotguns with shorter barrels and little or no barrel choke are highly popular for use in home defense, military and law enforcement, and are commonly known as [[riot shotgun|riot guns]]. The minimum barrel length for shotguns in most of the U.S. is {{convert|18|in|mm}}, and this barrel length (sometimes {{convert|18.5|-|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} to increase magazine capacity and/or ensure the gun is legal regardless of measuring differences<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mossberg.com/products/default.asp?id=5&display=specs |title=Mossberg & Sons &#124; Products |publisher=Mossberg.com |access-date=19 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814015009/http://www.mossberg.com/products/default.asp?id=5&display=specs |archive-date=14 August 2012 }}</ref>) is the primary choice for riot shotguns. The shorter barrel makes the weapon easier to maneuver around corners and in tight spaces, though slightly longer barrels are sometimes used outdoors for a tighter spread pattern or increased accuracy of slug projectiles. Home-defense and law enforcement shotguns are usually chambered for 12-gauge shells, providing maximum shot power and the use of a variety of projectiles such as buckshot, rubber, sandbag and slug shells, but 20-gauge (common in bird-hunting shotguns) or .410 (common in youth-size shotguns) are also available in defense-type shotgun models allowing easier use by novice shooters.\n\nA riot shotgun has many advantages over a handgun or rifle. Compared to "defense-caliber" handguns (chambered for [[9mm Parabellum]], [[.38 Special]], [[.357 Magnum]], [[.40 S&W]], [[.45 ACP]] and similar), a shotgun has far more power and damage potential (up to 10 times the muzzle energy of a [[.45 ACP]] cartridge), allowing a "[[stopping power|one-shot stop]]" that is more difficult to achieve with typical handgun loads. Compared to a rifle, riot shotguns are easier to maneuver due to the shorter barrel, still provide better damage potential at indoor distances (generally 3–5 meters/yards), and reduce the risk of "overpenetration"; that is, the bullet or shot passing completely through the target and continuing beyond, which poses a risk to those behind the target through walls. The wide spread of the shot reduces the importance of shot placement compared to a single projectile, which increases the effectiveness of "point shooting" – rapidly aiming simply by pointing the weapon in the direction of the target. This allows easy, fast use by novices.\n\n====Lever-action====\n[[File:M1887 LH.JPG|thumb|400px|A modern reproduction of the [[Winchester M1887]] lever-action shotgun]]\nEarly attempts at repeating shotguns invariably centred around either bolt-or [[lever-action]] designs, drawing inspiration from contemporary repeating rifles, with the earliest successful repeating shotgun being the lever-action [[Winchester M1887]], designed by John Browning at the behest of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.\n\nLever shotguns, while less common, were popular in the late 19th century with the Winchester Model 1887 and Model 1901 being prime examples. Initially very popular, demand waned after the introduction of pump-action shotguns around the start of the 20th century, and production was eventually discontinued in 1920.\n\nOne major issue with lever-actions (and to a lesser extent pump-actions) was that early shotgun shells were often made of paper or similar fragile materials (modern hulls are plastic or metal). As a result, the loading of shells, or working of the action of the shotgun, could often result in cartridges getting crushed and becoming unusable, or even damaging the gun.\n\nLever shotguns have seen a return to the gun market in recent years, however, with Winchester producing the Model 9410 (chambering the .410 gauge shotgun shell and using the action of the Winchester Model 94 series lever-action rifle, hence the name), and a handful of other firearm manufacturers (primarily [[Norinco]] of China and [[ADI Ltd.]] of Australia) producing versions of the Winchester Model 1887/1901 designed for modern 12-gauge [[smokeless powder|smokeless]] shotshells with more durable plastic casings. There has been a notable uptick in lever-action shotgun sales in Australia since 1997, when pump-actions were effectively outlawed.\n\n====Bolt-action====\n[[Bolt-action]] shotguns, while uncommon, do exist. One of the best-known examples is a 12-gauge manufactured by Mossberg featuring a 3-round magazine, marketed in Australia just after changes to the gun laws in 1997 heavily restricted the ownership and use of pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns. They were not a huge success, as they were somewhat slow and awkward to operate, and the rate of fire was noticeably slower (on average) than a double-barrelled gun. The [[Rifle Factory Ishapore]] in India also manufactured a single-shot [[.410 bore]] shotgun based on the [[Lee-Enfield|SMLE Mk III*]] rifle. The Russian Berdana shotgun was effectively a single-shot bolt-action rifle that became obsolete, and was subsequently modified to chamber 16-gauge shotgun shells for civilian sale. The U.S. military [[M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System|M26]] is also a bolt-action weapon. Bolt-action shotguns have also been used in the "goose gun" application, intended to kill birds such as [[geese]] at greater range. Typically, goose guns have long barrels (up to 36&nbsp;inches), and small bolt-fed magazines. Bolt-action shotguns are also used in conjunction with slug shells for the maximum possible accuracy from a shotgun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gun-tests.com/performance/apr97browning.html |title=April, 97 Browning |publisher=Gun-tests.com |access-date=5 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725055416/http://www.gun-tests.com/performance/apr97browning.html |archive-date=25 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn Australia, some straight-pull bolt-action shotguns, such as the Turkish-made Pardus BA12 and Dickinson T1000, the American [[M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System|C-More Competition M26]], as well as the indigenous-designed SHS STP 12, have become increasingly popular alternatives to lever-action shotguns, largely due to the better ergonomics with less stress on the shooter\'s trigger hand and fingers when cycling the action.\n\n====Revolver====\nColt briefly manufactured several revolving shotguns that were met with mixed success. The [[Colt Model 1839 Shotgun]] was manufactured between 1839 and 1841. Later, the Colt Model 1855 Shotgun, based on the [[Colt revolving rifle|Model 1855 revolving rifle]], was manufactured between 1860 and 1863. Because of their low production numbers and age they are among the rarest of all Colt firearms.<ref name="Sapp2007">{{cite book|last=Sapp|first=Rick|title=Standard Catalog of Colt Firearms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eBW-HqX24cC&pg=PA209|year=2007|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-2697-7|pages=198, 209}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Armsel Striker]] was a modern take on the revolving shotgun that held 10 rounds of 12-gauge ammunition in its cylinder.

It is produced by the [[TsKIB SOO]], Central Design and Research Bureau of Sporting and Hunting Arms. They are available in 12, 20, 28 and 32 gauges, and .410 bore.\n\n====Semi-automatic====\n[[File:Browning Auto-5 20g Mag.jpg|thumb|left|400px|A [[Browning A-5]] semi-automatic shotgun]]\n{{main|Semi-automatic shotgun}}\n[[Recoil operation|Recoil]]/[[recoil operation#Inertia|inertia-driven]] or [[gas-operated]] actions are other popular methods of increasing the rate of fire of a shotgun; these [[semi-automatic firearm|self-loading]] shotguns are generally referred to as \'\'autoloaders\'\'. Instead of having the action manually operated by a pump or lever, the action automatically cycles each time the shotgun is fired, ejecting the spent shell and reloading a fresh one into the chamber. The first successful semi-automatic shotgun was [[John Browning]]\'s [[Auto-5]], first produced by [[Fabrique Nationale]] beginning in 1902. Other well-known examples include the [[Remington 1100]], [[Benelli M1]], and [[Saiga-12]].\n\nSome, such as the [[Franchi SPAS-12]] and [[Benelli M3]], are capable of switching between semi-automatic and pump action. These are popular for two reasons; first, some jurisdictions forbid the use of semi-automatic actions for hunting, and second, lower-powered rounds, like "reduced-recoil" buckshot shells and many [[less-lethal]] cartridges, have insufficient power to reliably cycle a semi-automatic shotgun.\n\n====Automatic====\nFully [[automatic shotgun]]s, such as [[Auto Assault-12]] (AA-12) also exist, but they\'re still rare.\n\n====Other====\nIn addition to the commonly encountered shotgun actions already listed, there are also shotguns based on the [[Martini-Henry]] rifle design, originally designed by British arms maker [[W.W. Greener]].\n\nSome of the more interesting advances in shotgun technology include the versatile [[NeoStead 2000]] and fully automatics such as the [[Pancor Jackhammer]] or [[Atchisson Assault Shotgun|Auto-Assault 12]].\n\nIn 1925, Rodolfo Cosmi produced the first working [[prototype]] hybrid semi-automatic shotgun, which had an 8-round magazine located in the stock. While it reloaded automatically after each shot like a semi-automatic, it had a break-action to load the first shell. This design has only been repeated once, by Beretta with their UGB25 automatic shotgun. The user loads the first shell by breaking the gun in the manner of a break-action shotgun, then closes it and inserts the second shell into a clip on the gun\'s right side. The spent hulls are ejected downwards. The guns combine the advantages of the break action (they can be proven to be safe by breaking open, there are no flying hulls) with those of the semi-automatic (low recoil, low barrel axis position hence low muzzle flip).\n\nThe Italian firearms manufacturer [[Benelli Armi SpA]] also makes the [[Benelli M3]], a dual-mode hybrid shotgun that allows the user the choice of semi-automatic or pump-action operation. Pump-action operation is employed when shooting less [[muzzle energy|energetic]] shells (such as [[baton round]]s) that do not generate enough [[recoil]] to operate the semi-automatic mechanism. Conversely, the semi-automatic mode can be employed with more powerful shells, absorbing some of the recoil. Switching between the two modes is done by manipulating the ring located at the front of the [[foregrip]].\n\nThe French firearm manufacturer [[Verney-Carron]] produces the Véloce shotgun, a "lever-release blowback firearm" using [[bolt (firearms)|bolt]] catch mechanism like its similarly designed SpeedLine rifle. The Véloce is in essence a modified inertia-driven semi-automatic shotgun, but after [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]] the bolt is trapped by a bolt stop and cannot return to battery unless it is manually released by depressing a thumb lever near the tang of the grip. Because the gun will not chamber a new round without manual actuation, the design is technically not really a self-loading, and Verney-Carron described it as a "manual repeating shotgun". When Australian [[gun shop|firearm dealer]]s tried to import the Véloce shotgun in 2018, [[Australian Greens|Greens]]\' [[David Shoebridge]] and [[gun control|anti-gun]] groups such as [[Gun Control Australia]] caused a [[moral panic]] on the [[mainstream media]], calling it "semi-semi-automatic" that needed to be prohibited as a "rapid-fire weapon".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://davidshoebridge.org.au/2018/06/08/media-release-new-semi-semi-automatic-firearms-fresh-risk-to-public-safety/|title=New "semi-semi-automatic" firearms fresh risk to public safety|publisher=David Shoebridge – Media release|date=8 June 2018|access-date=13 December 2020|archive-date=29 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029102529/https://davidshoebridge.org.au/2018/06/08/media-release-new-semi-semi-automatic-firearms-fresh-risk-to-public-safety/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-30/push-to-import-rapid-fire-shotgun-to-australia-sparks-concerns/9807790|title=Push to import new \'rapid-fire\' shotgun into Australia sparks concerns|last=Carbonell|first=Rachel|newspaper=ABC News|date=30 May 2018|access-date=13 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/30/calls-to-ban-verney-carrons-fast-lever-action-rifle-in-australia|title=Calls to ban Verney-Carron\'s fast lever action rifle in Australia|last=Wahlquist|first=Calla|work=The Guardian|date=30 May 2018|access-date=13 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssaa.org.au/news-resources/politics/french-hunting-shotgun-choking-on-red-tape|title=French hunting shotgun choking on red tape|publisher=Sporting Shooters\' Association of Australia|date=7 June 2018|access-date=13 December 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Gauge ===<!-- Other articles link here -->\n[[File:Shotgun.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Army]] soldier armed with a [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun]]\n{{Main|Gauge (firearms)}}\nThe gauge number is determined by the weight, in fractions of a pound, of a solid sphere of lead with a diameter equal to the inside diameter of the barrel. So, a 10-gauge shotgun nominally should have an inside diameter equal to that of a sphere made from one-tenth of a pound of lead. Each gauge has a set [[caliber]]. By far the most common gauges are 12 (0.729 in, 18.5&nbsp;mm diameter) and 20 (0.614 in, 15.6&nbsp;mm), although 67 (.410 in diameter), 32, 28, 24, 16, and 10 (19.7&nbsp;mm) gauge also exist.\n\nDifferent gauges have different typical applications. 12-gauge shotguns are common for hunting geese, large ducks, or other big larger gamebirds; professional skeet and trap shooting; military applications; and home-defense applications. 16-gauge shotguns were once common for hunters who wanted to use only a single shotgun for gamebirds normally pursued with 12 or 20-gauge shotguns, but have become rarer in recent years. 20-gauge shotguns are often used for gamebirds such as doves, smaller ducks, and quail. 28-gauge shotguns are not as common, but are classic quail-hunting guns. .410 gauge shotguns are typically used for squirrel hunting or for sportsmen seeking the challenge of killing game with a smaller load.\n\nOther, less common shotgun cartridges have their own unique uses. Ammunition manufacturer CCI produces 9&nbsp;mm (.355 in.) and several other popular pistol calibers up to .45 ACP as well as .22 (5.5&nbsp;mm) for firing from handguns. These are commonly called snake shot cartridges.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0N4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA197|date=October 1947|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=197}}</ref> Larger gauges, up to 4 bore, too powerful to shoulder, have been built, but were generally affixed to small boats and referred to as [[punt gun]]s. These were used for commercial [[Anatidae|waterfowl]] hunting, to kill large numbers of birds resting on the water.\n\n[[File:Bond Arms Texas Defender Cowboy .45 .410.JPG|thumb|Bond Arms Cowboy Defender .45 Colt/.410 Shotshell Derringer]]\nHandguns have also been produced that are capable of firing either .45 (Long) Colt or .410 shotgun shells from the same chamber; they are commonly known as "snake guns". [[Derringer]]s such as the "[[Bond Arms|Snake Slayer and Cowboy Defender]]" are popular among some outdoors-men in the South and Southwest regions of the United States. There are also some revolvers, such as the [[Taurus Judge]] and [[Smith & Wesson Governor]], that are capable of shooting the [[.45LC]]/.410 rounds; but as with derringers they are not considered shotguns.\n\nThe [[.410 bore]] (10.4&nbsp;mm) is unusual, being measured in inches, and would be approximately 67 "real" gauge, though its short hull versions are nominally called 36-gauge in Europe. It uses a relatively small charge of shot. It is used for hunting and for skeet. Because of its very light recoil (approx 10 N), it is often used as a beginner\'s gun. However, the small charge and typically tight choke make it more difficult to hit targets. It is also frequently used by expert shooters because of the difficulty, especially in expensive side by side and over/under models for hunting small bird game such as quail and doves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/410bore.htm |title=410 Gauge |publisher=Chuckhawks.com |access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref> Inexpensive bolt-action .410 shotguns are a very common first hunting shotgun among young pre-teen hunters, as they are used mostly for hunting squirrels, while additionally teaching bolt-action manipulation skills that will transfer easily later to adult-sized hunting rifles. Most of these young hunters move up to a [[20-gauge shotgun|20-gauge]] within a few years, and to 12-gauge shotguns and full-size hunting rifles by their late teens. Still, many who are particularly recoil-averse choose to stay with 20-gauge shotguns all their adult life, as it is a suitable gauge for many popular hunting uses.\n\nA recent innovation is the back-boring of barrels, in which the barrels are bored out slightly larger than their actual gauge. This reduces the compression forces on the shot when it transitions from the chamber to the barrel. This leads to a slight reduction in perceived recoil, and an improvement in shot pattern due to reduced deformation of the shot.\n\n===Shot===\n[[File:USMC-05459.jpg|thumb|230px|U.S. Marines fire their shotguns]]\nMost shotguns are used to fire "a number of ball shot", in addition to slugs and sabots. The ball shot or pellets is for the most part made of lead but this has been partially replaced by bismuth, steel, tungsten-iron, tungsten-nickel-iron and even tungsten polymer loads. Non-toxic loads are required by Federal law for [[waterfowl hunting]] in the US, as the shot may be ingested by the waterfowl, which some authorities believe can lead to health problems due to the lead exposure. Shot is termed either [[birdshot]] or [[buckshot]] depending on the shot size. Informally, birdshot pellets have a diameter smaller than {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} and buckshot are larger than that. Pellet size is indicated by a number; for bird shot this ranges from the smallest 12 (1.2&nbsp;mm, 0.05 in) to 2 (3.8&nbsp;mm, 0.15 in) and then BB (4.6&nbsp;mm, 0.18 in).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0N4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA196|date=October 1947|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=196}}</ref>\n\nFor buckshot, the numbers start and end with 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 ("single-aught"), 00 ("double-aught"), 000 ("triple-aught"), and 0000 ("quadruple-aught"). A different informal distinction is that "bird shot" pellets are small enough that they can be measured into the cartridge by weight, and simply poured in, whereas "buckshot" pellets are so large they must be stacked inside the cartridge in a fixed geometric arrangement to fit. The diameter in hundredths of an inch of bird shot sizes from No. 9 to No. 1 can be obtained by subtracting the shot size from 17. Thus, No. 4 bird shot is 17 – 4 = 13 = {{convert|0.13|in|mm}} in diameter. Different terminology is used outside the United States. In England and Australia, for example, 00 buckshot cartridges are commonly referred to as "[[Buckshot|S.G.]]" (Swanshot gauge) cartridges.\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n|+ Table of American standard birdshot size\n|-\n!Size\n![[Caliber]]\n!Pellets/10 g lead\n!Pellets/10 g steel\n|-\n|align=center| FF||align=center| 5.84&nbsp;mm (.230")||align=center| 8 ||align=center| 12\n|-\n|align=center| F||align=center| 5.59&nbsp;mm (.220")||align=center| 10 ||align=center| 14\n|-\n|align=center| TT||align=center| 5.33&nbsp;mm (.210")||align=center| 11 ||align=center| 16\n|-\n|align=center| T||align=center| 5.08&nbsp;mm (.200")||align=center| 13 ||align=center| 19\n|-\n|align=center| BBB||align=center| 4.83&nbsp;mm (.190")||align=center| 15 ||align=center| 22\n|-\n|align=center| BB||align=center| 4.57&nbsp;mm (.180")||align=center| 18 ||align=center| 25\n|-\n|align=center| B||align=center| 4.32&nbsp;mm (.170")||align=center| 21 ||align=center| 30\n|-\n|align=center| 1||align=center| 4.06&nbsp;mm (.160")||align=center| 25  ||align=center| 36\n|-\n|align=center| 2||align=center| 3.81&nbsp;mm (.150")||align=center| 30 ||align=center| 44\n|-\n|align=center| 3||align=center| 3.56&nbsp;mm (.140")||align=center| 37  ||align=center| 54\n|-\n|align=center| 4||align=center| 3.30&nbsp;mm (.130")||align=center| 47 ||align=center| 68\n|-\n|align=center| 5||align=center| 3.05&nbsp;mm (.120")||align=center| 59 ||align=center| 86\n|-\n|align=center| 6||align=center| 2.79&nbsp;mm (.110")||align=center| 78 ||align=center| 112\n|-\n|align=center| 7||align=center| 2.41&nbsp;mm (.100")||align=center| 120 ||align=center| 174\n|-\n|align=center| 8||align=center| 2.29&nbsp;mm (.090")||align=center| 140 ||align=center| 202\n|-\n|align=center| 9||align=center| 2.03&nbsp;mm (.080")||align=center| 201 ||align=center| 290\n|}\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n|+ Table of buckshot size\n|-\n!Size\n![[Caliber]]\n!Pellets/10 g lead\n|-\n|align=center| 000 or LG ("triple-aught")||align=center| 9.1&nbsp;mm (.36")||align=center| 2.2\n|-\n|align=center| 00 or SG ("double-aught")||align=center| 8.4&nbsp;mm (.33")||align=center| 2.9\n|-\n|align=center| 0 ("one-aught")||align=center| 8.1&nbsp;mm (.32")||align=center| 3.1\n|-\n|align=center| 1||align=center| 7.6&nbsp;mm (.30")||align=center| 3.8\n|-\n|align=center| 2 or SSG||align=center| 6.9&nbsp;mm (.27")||align=center| 5.2\n|-\n|align=center| 3||align=center| 6.4&nbsp;mm (.25")||align=center| 6.6\n|-\n|align=center| 4||align=center| 6.1&nbsp;mm (.24")||align=center| 7.4\n|}\n\n===Pattern and choke===<!-- This section is linked from [[Flintlock]] -->\n{{main|Choke (firearms)}}\n{{See also|Slug barrel}}\nShot, small and round and delivered without spin, is ballistically inefficient. As the shot leaves the barrel it begins to disperse in the air. The resulting cloud of pellets is known as the shot [[pattern]], or [[shotgun shot spread]]. The ideal pattern would be a circle with an even distribution of shot throughout, with a density sufficient to ensure enough pellets will intersect the target to achieve the desired result, such as a kill when hunting or a break when shooting clay targets. In reality the pattern is closer to a [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], or normal distribution, with a higher density in the center that tapers off at the edges. Patterns are usually measured by firing at a {{convert|30|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter circle on a large sheet of paper placed at varying distances. The hits inside the circle are counted, and compared to the total number of pellets, and the density of the pattern inside the circle is examined. An "ideal" pattern would put nearly 100% of the pellets in the circle and would have no voids—any region where a target silhouette will fit and not cover 3 or more holes is considered a potential problem.\n\nA constriction in the end of the barrel known as the [[Choke (firearms)|choke]] is used to tailor the pattern for different purposes. Chokes may either be formed as part of the barrel at the time of manufacture, by squeezing the end of the bore down over a [[mandrel]], or by threading the barrel and screwing in an interchangeable choke tube. The choke typically consists of a conical section that smoothly tapers from the bore diameter down to the choke diameter, followed by a cylindrical section of the choke diameter. Briley Manufacturing, a maker of interchangeable shotgun chokes, uses a conical portion about three times the bore diameter in length, so the shot is gradually squeezed down with minimal deformation. The cylindrical section is shorter, usually {{convert|0.6|to|0.75|in|mm|abbr=off}}. The use of interchangeable chokes has made it easy to tune the performance of a given combination of shotgun and shotshell to achieve the desired performance.\n\nThe choke should be tailored to the range and size of the targets. A skeet shooter shooting at close targets might use 127 micrometres (0.005&nbsp;inches) of constriction to produce a {{convert|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter pattern at a distance of {{convert|19|m|yd|abbr=on}}. A [[trap shooting|trap]] shooter shooting at distant targets might use 762 micrometres (0.030&nbsp;inches) of constriction to produce a {{convert|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter pattern at {{convert|37|m|yd|abbr=on}}. Special chokes for turkey hunting, which requires long range shots at the small head and neck of the bird, can go as high as 1500 micrometres (0.060&nbsp;inches). The use of too much choke and a small pattern increases the difficulty of hitting the target, whereas the use of too little choke produces large patterns with insufficient pellet density to reliably break targets or kill game. "Cylinder barrels" have no constriction.\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n|+ Table of shotgun chokes<br />for a 12-gauge shotgun using lead shot\n|-\n!Constriction<br />(micrometres)\n!Constriction<br />(inches)\n!American name\n!British name\n!Percentage of shot<br />in a {{convert|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} circle <br />at {{convert|37|m|yd|abbr=on}}\n!Total spread at 37 m <br /> (cm)\n!Total spread at 40 yds <br /> (in)\n!Effective range<br /> (m)\n!Effective range<br /> (yd)\n|-\n|align=center| 0||align=center| .000|| Cylinder|| ||align=center| 40||align=center| 150||align=center| 59||align=center| 18||align=center|20\n|-\n|align=center| 127||align=center| .005|| Skeet|| 1/8||align=center| 45||align=center| 132||align=center| 52||align=center| 21||align=center|23\n|-\n|align=center| 254||align=center| .010|| Improved Cylinder|| 1/4||align=center| 50||align=center| 124||align=center| 49||align=center| 23||align=center|25\n|-\n|align=center| 381||align=center| .015|| Light Modified|| || &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;\n|-\n|align=center| 508||align=center| .020|| Modified|| 1/2||align=center| 60||align=center| 117||align=center| 46||align=center| 32||align=center|35\n|-\n|align=center| 635||align=center| .025|| Improved Modified|| 3/4|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;\n|-\n|align=center| 762||align=center| .030|| Light Full|| || &nbsp;||align=center| 109||align=center| 43|| &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|-\n|align=center| 889||align=center| .035|| Full|| 1/1||align=center| 70|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;||align=center| 37||align=center|40\n|-\n|align=center| 1143||align=center| .045|| Extra Full|| || &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;\n|-\n|align=center| 1270||align=center| .050|| Super Full|| || &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;|| &nbsp;\n|}\n\nOther specialized choke tubes exist as well. Some turkey hunting tubes have constrictions greater than "Super Full", or additional features like porting to reduce recoil, or "straight rifling" that is designed to stop any spin that the shot column might acquire when traveling down the barrel. These tubes are often extended tubes, meaning they project beyond the end of the bore, giving more room for things like a longer conical section. Shot spreaders or diffusion chokes work opposite of normal chokes—they are designed to spread the shot more than a cylinder bore, generating wider patterns for very short range use. A number of recent spreader chokes, such as the Briley "Diffusion" line, actually use rifling in the choke to spin the shot slightly, creating a wider spread. The Briley Diffusion uses a 1 in 36&nbsp;cm twist, as does the FABARM Lion Paradox shotgun.\n\nOval chokes, which are designed to provide a shot pattern wider than it is tall, are sometimes found on [[combat shotgun]]s, primarily those of the [[Vietnam War]] era. They were available for aftermarket addition in the 1970s from companies like A & W Engineering.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Police Shotgun Manual|publisher=Thomas|author=Roger H. Robinson|year=1973|isbn=978-0-398-02630-1|pages=91–94}}</ref> Military versions of the Ithaca 37 with \'\'duckbill\'\' choke were used in limited numbers during the Vietnam War by US Navy Seals. It arguably increased effectiveness in close range engagements against multiple targets. Two major disadvantages plagued the system. One was erratic patterning. The second was that the shot would spread too quickly providing a limited effective zone.\n\nOffset chokes, where the pattern is intentionally slightly off of center, are used to change the point of impact. For instance, an offset choke can be used to make a double barrelled shotgun with poorly aligned barrels hit the same spot with both barrels.\n\n===Barrel length===\nShotguns generally have longer barrels than modern rifles. Unlike rifles, however, the long shotgun barrel is not for ballistic purposes; shotgun shells use small powder charges in large diameter bores, and this leads to very low muzzle pressures (see [[internal ballistics]]) and very little velocity change with increasing barrel length. According to Remington, modern powder in a shotgun burns completely in 25 (9.8425&nbsp;in) to 36 (14.173&nbsp;in)&nbsp;cm barrels.\n\nSince shotguns are generally used for shooting at small, fast moving targets, it is important to \'\'lead\'\' the target by firing slightly ahead of the target, so that when the shot reaches the range of the target, the target will have moved into the pattern.\n\nShotguns made for close ranges, where the angular speed of the targets is great (such as skeet or upland bird hunting), tend to have shorter barrels, around {{convert|24|to|28|in|mm|abbr=off}}. Shotguns for longer range shooting, where angular speeds are small (trap shooting; quail, pheasant, and waterfowl hunting), tend to have longer barrels, 28 to {{convert|36|in|mm}}. The longer barrels have more [[angular momentum]], and will therefore swing more slowly but more steadily. The short, low angular momentum barrels swing faster, but are less steady. These lengths are for pump or semi-auto shotguns; break open guns have shorter overall lengths for the same barrel length, and so will use longer barrels. The break open design saves between {{convert|9|and|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in overall length, but in most cases pays for this by having two barrels, which adds weight at the muzzle. Barrels for shotguns have been getting longer as modern steels and production methods make the barrels stronger and lighter; a longer, lighter barrel gives the same inertia for less overall weight.\n\nShotguns for use against larger, slower targets generally have even shorter barrels. Small game shotguns, for hunting game like rabbits and squirrels, or shotguns for use with buckshot for deer, are often {{convert|56|to|61|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nShotguns intended for all-round hunting are a compromise, but a {{convert|72|to|74|cm|in|abbr=on}} barrel pump-action 12-gauge shotgun with a modified choke can serve admirably for use as one gun intended for general all-round hunting of small-game such as quails, rabbits, pheasants, doves, and squirrels in semi-open wooded or farmland areas in many parts of the eastern US (Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee) where dense brush is less of a hindrance and the ability to have more reach is important. For hunting in dense brush, shorter barrel lengths are often preferred when hunting the same types of game.\n\n===Caliber conversion sleeves===\nShotguns are well suited for the use of [[caliber conversion sleeve]]s, allowing most single- and double-barrel shotguns to fire a wide range of ammunition.<ref name="soldiersystems.net">http://soldiersystems.net/2012/11/23/x-caliber-survival-rifle-gauge-adapter-system/ X-CALIBER Survival-Rifle Gauge Adapter System</ref><ref>https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/x-caliber/ X-Caliber X-treme: Multi-Caliber Weapons.

The X caliber 12-gauge adapter sleeves also come in [[.22 Long Rifle]], [[.223 Remington]], [[7.62x39mm]] and [[.308 Winchester]] as well.<ref name="soldiersystems.net"/> They even make four adapter sleeves that allow the 20-gauge models to fire: 9mm Luger, .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .45 ACP, .45 Long Colt, and .410 gauge ammunition.\n\n==Ammunition==\n{{Main|Shotgun shell}}\n[[File:Shotgunammo.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Loading [[12-gauge]] shells]]\nThe extremely large caliber of shotgun shells has led to a wide variety of different ammunition.\n\n\'\'\'[[Shotgun shell|Shotshells]]\'\'\' are the most commonly used round, filled with lead or lead substitute pellets.\n\nOf this general class, the most common subset is \'\'\'birdshot\'\'\', which uses a large number (from dozens to hundreds) of small pellets, meant to create a wide "kill spread" to hunt birds in flight. Shot shells are described by the size and number of the pellets within, and numbered in reverse order (the smaller the number, the bigger the pellet size, similar to bore gauge). Size nine (#9) shot is the smallest size normally used for hunting and is used on small [[upland game bird]]s such as [[dove]] and [[quail]]. Larger sizes are used for hunting larger upland game birds and [[waterfowl]].\n\n\'\'\'[[Buckshot]]\'\'\' is similar to but larger than birdshot, and was originally designed for hunting larger game, such as deer (hence the name). While the advent of new, more accurate slug technologies is making buckshot less attractive for hunting, it is still the most common choice for police, military, and [[Self-defense|home defense]] uses. Like birdshot, buckshot is described by pellet size, with larger numbers indicating smaller shot. From the smallest to the largest, buckshot sizes are: #4, (called "number four"), #1, 0 ("one-aught"), 00 ("[[double-ought buck|double-aught]]"), 000 ("triple-aught") and 0000 ("four-aught"). A typical round for defensive use would be a 12-gauge {{convert|2+3/4|in|cm}} length 00 buck shell, which contains 9 pellets roughly {{convert|8.4|mm|in}} in diameter, each comparable to a [[.38 Special]] bullet in damage potential. New "tactical" buckshot rounds, designed specifically for defensive use, use slightly fewer shot at lower velocity to reduce recoil and increase controllability of the shotgun. There are some shotgun rounds designed specifically for police use that shoot effectively from {{convert|50|yd}} with a 20" diameter grouping of the balls.\n\n\'\'\'[[shotgun slug|Slug]]\'\'\' rounds are rounds that fire a single solid slug. They are used for hunting large game, and in certain military and law enforcement applications. Modern slugs are moderately accurate, especially when fired from special rifled slug barrels. They are often used in "shotgun-only" hunting zones near inhabited areas, where rifles are prohibited due to their greater range.\n\n\'\'\'Sabots\'\'\' are a common type of slug round. While some slugs are exactly that—a 12-gauge metal projectile in a cartridge—a sabot is a smaller but more aerodynamic projectile surrounded by a "shoe" of some other material. This "sabot" jacket seals the barrel, increasing pressure and acceleration, while also inducing spin on the projectile in a rifled barrel. Once the projectile clears the barrel, the sabot material falls away, leaving an unmarked, aerodynamic bullet to continue toward the target. The advantages over a traditional slug are increased shot power{{what?|date=February 2022}}, increased bullet velocity due to the lighter-mass bullet, and increased accuracy due to the velocity and the reduction in deformation of the slug itself. Disadvantages versus a traditional slug include lower muzzle momentum due to reduced mass, reduced damage due to smaller bullet diameter, and significantly higher per-unit cost.\n\n===Specialty ammunition===\nThe unique properties of the shotgun, such as large case capacity, large bore, and the lack of rifling, has led to the development of a large variety of specialty shells, ranging from novelties to high tech military rounds.\n\n====Hunting, defensive, and military====\n\'\'\'Brenneke\'\'\' and Foster type slugs have the same basic configuration as normal slugs, but have increased accuracy. The hollowed rear of the Foster slug improves accuracy by placing more mass in the front of the projectile, therefore inhibiting the "tumble" that normal slugs may generate. The Brenneke slug takes this concept a bit further, with the addition of a wad that stays connected to the projectile after discharge, increasing accuracy. Both slugs are commonly found with fins or ribs, which are meant to allow the projectile to safely squeeze down during passage through chokes, but they do not increase stability in flight.\n\n\'\'\'[[Flechette]]\'\'\' rounds contain aerodynamic darts, typically from 8 to 20 in number. The flechettes provide greatly extended range due to their aerodynamic shape and improved penetration of light armor. American troops during the [[Vietnam War]] packed their own flechette shotgun rounds, called \'\'beehive rounds\'\' after the similar [[artillery]] rounds. However, terminal performance was poor due to the very light weight of the flechettes, and their use was quickly dropped.\n\n\'\'\'Grenade\'\'\' rounds use exploding projectiles to increase long range lethality. These are currently experimental, but the British [[FRAG-12]], which comes in [[High Explosive]] (HE), High Explosive [[Armor-piercing]] (HEAP) and High Explosive Fragmenting Antipersonnel (HEFA) forms, is under consideration by military forces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcwl.usmc.mil/factsheets/FRAG12%205%20Aug%2005.pdf |title= FRAG-12 fact sheet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413202508/http://www.mcwl.usmc.mil/factsheets/FRAG12%205%20Aug%2005.pdf |archive-date=13 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army-technology.com/features/feature106869/|title=High Explosive: Innovations in Ammunition – Army Technology|date=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensereview.com/auto-assault-12-shotgunfrag-12-high-explosive-round-comboweapon-system/|title=Auto Assault-12 (AA-12) Full-Auto Machine Shotgun/FRAG-12 High-Explosive Round Combo/Weapon System!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV379084djs| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/WV379084djs| archive-date=2021-10-29|title=The AA-12 shotgun |last=Haloskulls117|date=29 June 2010 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n====Less-lethal rounds, for riot and animal control====\n[[File:Fiocchi rubber buckshot.jpg|thumb|right|Two rounds of Fiocchi 12-gauge rubber buckshot]]\n\'\'\'[[Flexible baton round]]s\'\'\', commonly called \'\'bean bags\'\', fire a fabric bag filled with birdshot or a similar loose, dense substance. The "punch" effect of the bag is useful for knocking down targets; the rounds are used by police to subdue violent suspects. The bean bag round is by far the most common [[less-lethal]] round used. Due to the large surface area of these rounds, they lose velocity rapidly, and must be used at fairly short ranges to be effective, though use at extremely short ranges, under {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}}, can result in broken bones or other serious or lethal injuries. The rounds can also fly in a frisbee-like fashion and cut the person or animal being fired at. For this reason, these types of rounds are referred to as less-lethal, as opposed to less-than-lethal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/206089.pdf |title=NIJ : Research for Practice : Impact Munitions Use: Types, Targets, Effects |publisher=Ncjrs.gov |access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n\'\'\'Gas\'\'\' shells spray a cone of gas for several meters. These are primarily used by riot police. They normally contain [[pepper gas]] or [[tear gas]]. Other variations launch a gas-grenade-like projectile.\n\n\'\'\'Rock salt\'\'\' shells are hand loaded with coarse [[Halite|rock salt]] crystals, replacing the standard lead or steel shot. Rock salt shells could be seen as the forerunners of modern less-lethal rounds. In the United States, rock salt shells were and are sometimes still used by rural civilians to defend their property. The brittle salt was unlikely to cause serious injury at long ranges, but would cause painful stinging injuries and served as a warning. British gamekeepers have used rock salt shells to deter poachers. Rather than get into a physical confrontation, they stalk the poachers, making themselves known by a loud shout of "Run!" just before firing, to avoid hitting the now-fleeing subject in the eyes.\n\n\'\'\'Rubber slugs\'\'\' or \'\'\'rubber buckshot\'\'\' are similar in principle to the bean bag rounds. Composed of flexible rubber or plastic and fired at low velocities, these rounds are probably the most common choice for riot control.\n\n[[Taser International]] announced in 2007 a new 12-gauge \'\'\'eXtended Range Electronic Projectile\'\'\' or \'\'\'XREP\'\'\', which contains a small [[electroshock weapon]] unit in a carrier that can be fired from a standard 12-gauge shotgun. The XREP projectile is fin stabilized, and travels at an initial velocity of 100&nbsp;m/s (300&nbsp;ft/s). Barbs on the front attach the electroshock unit to the target, with a tassel deploying from the rear to widen the circuit. A twenty-second burst of electrical energy is delivered to the target.

The one exception is a [[sawed-off shotgun]], especially a [[lupara]], as it is more easily concealed than a normal shotgun.\n\n===Australia===\nWithin Australia, all shotguns manufactured after 1 January 1901 are considered firearms and are subject to registration and licensing. Most shotguns (including [[break-action]], [[bolt-action]] and [[lever-action]] shotguns) are classed as "Category A" weapons and, as such, are comparatively easy to obtain a licence for, given a legally recognised "legitimate reason" (compare to the British requirement for "good reason" for a [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom#Firearm licensing|FAC]]), such as [[sport shooting]] or [[hunting]]. However, [[pump-action]] and [[semi-automatic shotgun]]s are classed as "Category C" (magazine capacity no more than 5 rounds) or "Category D" (magazine capacity more than 5 rounds) weapons; a licence for this type of firearm is, practically speaking, unavailable to the average citizen due to the difficulty and [[red tape]] of acquiring one. For more information, see [[Gun politics in Australia]].\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:Beanbag shotgun.jpg|thumb|upright|A RCMP officer in 2010 armed with a shotgun outfitted to fire beanbag rounds]]\nCanada has three classifications of firearms: non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited. Shotguns are found in all three classes.\n\nAll non-restricted shotguns must have an overall length of at least {{convert|660|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Semi-automatic shotguns must also have a barrel length of more than {{convert|469.9|mm|in|abbr=on}} and have a capacity of 5 shells or less in the magazine to remain non-restricted. All other shotgun action types (pump/slide, break open, lever, bolt) do not have a magazine limit restriction or a minimum barrel length provided the overall length of the firearm remains more than {{convert|660|mm|in|abbr=on}} and the barrel was produced by an approved manufacturer. Shotgun barrels may only be reduced in length to a minimum of {{convert|457|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Non-restricted shotguns may be possessed with any [[Possession and Acquisition Licence]] (PAL) or [[Possession-Only License]] (POL) and may be transported throughout the country without special authorization and may be used for hunting certain species at certain times of the year.\n\nSemi-automatic shotguns with a barrel length of less than {{convert|469.9|mm|in|abbr=on}} are considered restricted and any shotgun that has been altered so its barrel length is less than {{convert|457|mm|in|abbr=on}} or if its overall length is less than {{convert|660|mm|in|abbr=on}} is considered prohibited.<ref>{{cite web| title=Prohibited Firearms| publisher=Cfc-cafc.gc.ca| url=http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/factsheets/prohibited_e.asp| access-date=19 February 2015| date=31 December 2008| archive-date=20 August 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820143113/http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/factsheets/prohibited_e.asp| url-status=dead}}</ref> Restricted and prohibited shotguns may be possessed with a PAL or POL that has been endorsed for restricted or prohibited [[grandfathered]] firearms.

The government provided amnesty from prosecution to shotgun and rifle owners if they fail to register non-restricted shotguns and rifles.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=80f74558-04f9-469f-8dd1-5a7cf4b8ce7e|publisher=Canada.com |title=Government extends gun-registration amnesty |access-date=26 May 2008 | date=14 May 2008 |author=Tim Naumetz}}</ref> The long gun portion of the registry was scrapped in 2011.\n\nSee online<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/factsheets/r&p_e.asp |title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police – Canadian Firearms Program &#124; Gendarmerie royale du Canada – Programme canadien des armes à feu |publisher=Cfc-cafc.gc.ca |date=31 December 2008 |access-date=19 February 2015 |archive-date=30 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730233033/http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/factsheets/r%26p_e.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref> for an official Canadian list of non-restricted and restricted and prohibited firearms.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom, a [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom#Shotguns|Shotgun Certificate]] (SGC) is required to possess a "Section 2" shotgun. These cost £50 and can only be denied if the chief of police in the area believes and can prove that the applicant poses a real danger to the public, or if the applicant has been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of three years or more or if the applicant cannot securely store a shotgun (gun clamps, wire locks and locking gun cabinets are considered secure). The round number restrictions apply only to the magazine, not the chamber, so it is legal to have a single-barreled semi-auto or pump-action shotgun that holds three rounds in total, or a shotgun with separate chambers (which would need to also be multi-barrelled). For a shotgun to qualify as a section 2 shotgun, it must meet the following criteria:\n\n(a) has a barrel not less than {{convert|24|in|mm}} in length and does not have any barrel with a bore more than {{convert|2|in|mm}} in diameter;\n\n(b) either has no magazine or has a non-detachable magazine not capable of holding more than two cartridges;\n\n(c) is not a revolver gun.\n\nPrior to a SGC being issued an interview is conducted with the local Firearms Officer, in the past this was a duty undertaken by the local police although more recently this function has been "contracted out" to civilian staff. The officer will check the location and suitability of the gun safe that is to be used for storage and conduct a general interview to establish the reasons behind the applicant requiring a SGC.\n\nAn SGC holder can own any number of shotguns meeting these requirements so long as he/she can store them securely. No certificate is required to own shotgun ammunition, but one is required to buy it. There is no restriction on the amount of shotgun ammunition that can be bought or owned. There are also no rules regarding the storage of ammunition.\n\nHowever, shotgun ammunition which contains fewer than 6 projectiles requires a section 1 Firearms Certificate (FAC). Shotguns with a magazine capacity greater than 2 rounds are also considered to be section 1 firearms and, as such, require an FAC to own. An FAC costs £50 but is much more restrictive than an SGC. The applicant must nominate two referees who are known to the applicant to vouch for his or her character; a new \'variation\' is required for each new caliber of gun to be owned; limits are set on how much ammunition a person can own at any one time; and an FAC can be denied if the applicant does not have sufficient \'good reason\'. \'Good reason\' generally means hunting, collecting, or target shooting – though other reasons may be acceptable. Personal defense is not an acceptable reason.\n\nAny pump-action or semi-automatic smoothbore gun (such as a shotgun) with a barrel length of less than 24 inches or total length of less than 40 inches is considered to be a section 5 firearm, that is, one that is subject to general prohibition, unless it is chambered for .22 caliber rimfire ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27|title=Firearms Act 1968|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:United States President Barack Obama shoots clay targets on the range at Camp David, Maryland.jpg|thumb|[[Barack Obama]] skeet shooting with a [[Browning Citori]] 525 on the range at [[Camp David]]]]\nIn the US, federal law prohibits shotguns from being capable of holding more than three shells including the round in the chamber when used for hunting migratory gamebirds such as doves, ducks, and geese. For other uses, a capacity of any number of shells is generally permitted. Most magazine-fed shotguns come with a removable magazine plug to limit capacity to 2, plus one in the chamber, for hunting migratory gamebirds. Certain states have restrictions on magazine capacity or design features under hunting or [[assault weapon]] laws.\n\nShotguns intended for defensive use have barrels as short as {{convert|18|in|cm}} for private use (the minimum shotgun barrel length allowed by law in the United States without federal registration. Barrel lengths of less than {{convert|18|in|cm}} as measured from the breechface to the muzzle when the weapon is in battery, or have an overall length of less than {{convert|26|in|cm}} are classified as short barreled shotguns (SBS) under the 1934 [[National Firearms Act]] and are regulated. A similar short barreled weapon having a pistol grip may be classified as an [[Any Other Weapon#Any other weapon|AOW]] or "Any Other Weapon" or "Firearm," depending on barrel length. A shotgun is defined as a weapon (with a [[stock (firearm)|buttstock]]) designed to be fired from the shoulder. The classification varies depending on how the weapon was originally manufactured.\n\nShotguns used by military, police, and other government agencies are regulated under the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934; however, they are exempt from transfer taxes. These weapons commonly have barrels as short as {{convert|12|to|14|in|cm|abbr=off}} so that they are easier to handle in confined spaces. Non-prohibited private citizens may own short-barreled shotguns by passing extensive background checks (state and local laws may be more restrictive) as well as paying a $200 federal tax and being issued a stamp. Defensive shotguns sometimes have no [[stock (firearm)|buttstock]] or will have a folding [[stock (firearm)|stock]] to reduce overall length even more when required. [[Any Other Weapon#Any other weapon|AOWs]] transfer with a $5 tax stamp from the [[BATFE]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Antique guns]]\n* [[Gun safety]]\n* [[List of shotguns]]\n* [[Double-barreled shotgun]]\n* [[Riding shotgun]]\n* [[Shotgun marriage|Shotgun wedding]]\n* [[Military 12-gauge cartridges]]\n* [[Mare\'s Leg#Shotgun|Mare\'s Leg]]\n* [[Shotgun (shooting sports)]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book | author = Bob Brister\n | title = Shotgunning, The Art and the Science\n | location= New Jersey | publisher=New Win Publishing\n | year = 1976\n | isbn = 978-0-8329-1840-7}}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Elmer Keith\n | title = Shotguns\n | location= Pennsylvania | publisher=The Stackpole Company\n | year = 1950\n | isbn = 978-0-935632-58-3 }}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Michael McIntosh\n | title = Best Guns\n | location= Alabama | publisher=Countrysport Press\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 978-0-924357-79-4}}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Jack O\'Connor\n | title = The Shotgun Book\n | url = https://archive.org/details/shotgunbook0000unse\n | url-access = registration\n | location= New York | publisher=Alfred A.
