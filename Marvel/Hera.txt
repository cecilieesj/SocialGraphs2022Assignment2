It was replaced later by the [[Heraion of Samos]], one of the largest of all Greek temples (altars were in front of the temples under the open sky). There were many temples built on this site, so the evidence is somewhat confusing, and archaeological dates are uncertain.\n\nThe temple created by the [[Rhoecus]] sculptors and architects was destroyed between 570 and 560 BCE. This was replaced by the [[Polycrates|Polycratean]] temple of 540‚Äì530 BCE. In one of these temples, we see a forest of 155 columns. There is also no evidence of tiles on this temple suggesting either the temple was never finished or that the temple was open to the sky.\n\nEarlier sanctuaries, whose dedication to Hera is less certain, were of the Mycenaean type called "house sanctuaries".<ref>Martin Persson Nilsson, \'\'The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and Its Survival in Greek Religion\'\' (Lund) 1950 pt.

Compared to this mighty goddess, who also possessed the earliest temple at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and two of the great fifth and sixth-century temples of [[Paestum]], the [[termagant]] of [[Homer]] and the myths is an "almost... comic figure", according to [[Walter Burkert|Burkert]].<ref>[[Walter Burkert|Burkert]], p. 132, including quote; Burkert: \'\'Orientalizing Revolution\'\'.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Temple of Hera - Agrigento - Italy 2015.JPG|thumb|left|The Temple of Hera at [[Agrigento]], [[Magna Graecia]].]]\nThough the greatest and earliest free-standing temple to Hera was the [[Heraion of Samos]], in the Greek mainland Hera was especially worshipped as "Argive Hera" (\'\'Hera Argeia\'\') at her sanctuary that stood between the former Mycenaean city-states of [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]] and [[Mycenae]],<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], \'\'Description of Greece\'\' 3.13.6</ref><ref>Her name appears, with Zeus and Hermes, in a [[Linear B]] inscription (Tn 316) at Mycenean [[Pylos]] (John Chadwick, \'\'The Mycenaean World\'\' [Cambridge University Press] 1976:89).</ref> where the festivals in her honor called \'\'[[Heraean Games|Heraia]]\'\' were celebrated. "The three cities I love best," the ox-eyed Queen of Heaven declares in the \'\'[[Iliad]]\'\', book iv, "are Argos, Sparta and Mycenae of the broad streets." There were also temples to Hera in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Tiryns]], [[Perachora]] and the sacred island of [[Delos]]. In [[Magna Graecia]], two Doric temples to Hera were constructed at [[Paestum]], about 550 BCE and about 450 BCE.

In Homer\'s \'\'Iliad\'\', when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by Zeus himself, would be born and rule all those around him. Hera, after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]] and made the wife of [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]] (son of Perseus) give birth to [[Eurystheus]] after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfillment of Zeus\'s oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles.<ref name="Hom.

The witches were successful in preventing the birth until [[Galanthis|Historis]], daughter of Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches.

He had previously wounded her severely in the breast.\n\nWhen Heracles reached adulthood, Hera [[Insanity|drove him mad]], which led him to murder his family and this later led to him undertaking his famous labours. Hera assigned Heracles to labour for King [[Eurystheus]] at Mycenae. She attempted to make almost all of Heracles\' twelve labours more difficult. When he fought the [[Lernaean Hydra]], she sent a [[Karkinos|crab]] to bite at his feet in the hopes of distracting him. Later Hera stirred up the Amazons against him when he was on one of his quests. When Heracles took the cattle of [[Geryon]], he shot Hera in the right breast with a triple-barbed arrow: the wound was incurable and left her in constant pain, as [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]] tells [[Aphrodite]] in the \'\'[[Iliad]]\'\', Book V. Afterwards, Hera sent a [[gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them and scatter them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the water level of a river so much that Heracles could not ford the river with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\nEurystheus also wanted to sacrifice the [[Cretan Bull]] to Hera. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, becoming known as the [[Marathonian Bull]].\n\nSome myths state that in the end, Heracles befriended Hera by saving her from [[Porphyrion]], a giant who tried to rape her during the [[Gigantomachy]], and that she even gave her daughter [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] as his bride.

They chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince. After bathing in the spring of [[Mount Ida]] where Troy was situated, they appeared before Paris to have him choose. The goddesses undressed before him, either at his request or for the sake of winning. Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera offered Paris political power and control of all of [[Asia Minor|Asia]], while Athena offered wisdom, fame, and glory in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory, "dark age" and archaic period|Sparta]]. The other two goddesses were enraged by this and through Helen\'s abduction by Paris, they brought about the [[Trojan War]].\n\n=== \'\'The Iliad\'\' ===\nHera plays a substantial role in \'\'[[The Iliad]]\'\', appearing in several books throughout the epic poem. She hates the [[Troy|Trojans]] because of Paris\' decision that [[Aphrodite]] was the most beautiful goddess, and so supports the Greeks during the war. Throughout the epic, Hera makes many attempts to thwart the Trojan army. In books 1 and 2, Hera declares that the Trojans must be destroyed. Hera persuades [[Athena]] to aid the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in battle and she agrees to assist with interfering on their behalf.<ref name="Iliad">{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Iliad|url=https://archive.org/details/theiliad02199gut}}</ref>\n\nIn book 5, Hera and Athena plot to harm [[Ares]], who had been seen by [[Diomedes]] in assisting the Trojans. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly. Hera, Ares\' mother, saw Ares\' interference and asked [[Zeus]], Ares\' father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares and he threw his spear at the god. Athena drove the spear into Ares\' body, and he bellowed in pain and fled to [[Mount Olympus]], forcing the Trojans to fall back.<ref name="Iliad" />\n\n[[Image:James Barry 001.jpg|thumb|\'\'Jupiter and Juno on Mount Ida\'\' by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], 1773 (City Art Galleries, Sheffield)]]\n\nIn book 8, Hera tries to persuade [[Poseidon]] to disobey Zeus and help the Achaean army. He refuses, saying he doesn\'t want to go against Zeus. Determined to intervene in the war, Hera and Athena head to the battlefield. However, seeing the two flee, Zeus sent Iris to intercept them and make them return to Mount Olympus or face grave consequences. After prolonged fighting, Hera sees Poseidon aiding the Greeks and giving them the motivation to keep fighting.\n\nIn book 14 Hera devises a plan to deceive Zeus. Zeus set a decree that the gods were not allowed to interfere in the mortal war. Hera is on the side of the Achaeans, so she plans a [[Deception of Zeus]] where she seduces him, with help from Aphrodite, and tricks him into a deep sleep, with the help of [[Hypnos]], so that the Gods could interfere without the fear of Zeus.<ref>Homer. \'\'Iliad\'\', Book 14, Lines 153-353.</ref>\n\nIn book 21, Hera continues her interference with the battle as she tells [[Hephaestus]] to prevent the river from harming [[Achilles]]. Hephaestus sets the battlefield ablaze, causing the river to plead with Hera, promising her he will not help the Trojans if Hephaestus stops his attack. Hephaestus stops his assault and Hera returns to the battlefield where the gods begin to fight amongst themselves.<ref name="Iliad" />\n\n=== Minor stories ===\n[[Image:Hera Prometheus Cdm Paris 542.jpg|thumb|Hera and [[Prometheus]], [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] of a 5th-century BCE cup from [[Vulci]], [[Etruria]]]]\n\n====Semele and Dionysus====\n{{See also|Dionysus#Birth}}\nWhen Hera learned that [[Semele]], daughter of [[Cadmus]] King of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], was pregnant by Zeus, she disguised herself as Semele\'s nurse and persuaded the princess to insist that Zeus show himself to her in his true form. When he was compelled to do so, having sworn by [[Styx]],<ref name="Hamilton">Hamilton, Edith (1969). "Mythology".</ref> his thunder and lightning destroyed Semele. Zeus took Semele\'s unborn child, [[Dionysus]], and completed its gestation sewn into his own thigh.\n\nIn another version, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus by either Demeter or [[Persephone]]. Hera sent her Titans to rip the baby apart, from which he was called Zagreus ("Torn in Pieces"). Zeus rescued the heart; or, the heart was saved, variously, by [[Athena]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], or [[Demeter]].<ref>Seyffert \'\'Dictionary\'\'</ref> Zeus used the heart to recreate [[Dionysus]] and implant him in the womb of Semele‚Äîhence Dionysus became known as "the twice-born". Certain versions imply that Zeus gave Semele the heart to eat to impregnate her. Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to reveal his true form, which killed her. Dionysus later managed to rescue his mother from the underworld and have her live on Mount Olympus.\n\n====Lamia====\n[[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]] was a lovely queen of [[Libya]], whom Zeus loved and slept with. Hera in jealousy caused Lamia to kill her own children; out of grief for her actions, Lamia was turned into a misshapen creature that would therefore snatch and murder other people\'s children.<ref>Suidas, \'\'[[Suda]]\'\', [https://topostext.org/work/240#la.84 {{math|ŒõŒ±ŒºŒØŒ±}}]</ref>{{cn|date=January 2022}}\n\n====Gerana====\n[[Gerana]] was a queen of the [[Pygmies]] who boasted she was more beautiful than Hera.

The oxen which were to pull her cart were overdue and her sons, [[Kleobis and Biton|Biton]] and [[Cleobis]], pulled the cart the entire way (45 [[stadia (length)|stadia]], 8 kilometers). Cydippe was impressed with their devotion to her and Hera, and so asked Hera to give her children the best gift a god could give a person. Hera ordained that the brothers would die in their sleep.\n\nThis honor bestowed upon the children was later used by [[Solon]] as proof when trying to convince [[Croesus]] that it is impossible to judge a person\'s happiness until they have died a fruitful death after a joyous life.<ref>Herodotus\' \'\'History\'\', Book I</ref>\n\n====Tiresias====\n[[Tiresias]] was a priest of Zeus, and as a young man, he encountered two snakes mating and hit them with a stick. He was then transformed into a woman. As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married, and had children, including [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]]. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias again found mating snakes; depending on the myth, either she made sure to leave the snakes alone this time, or, according to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], trampled on them and became a man once more.<ref>Hygini, \'\'[[Gaius Julius Hyginus#Fabulae|Fabulae]]\'\', LXXV</ref>\n\nAs a result of his experiences, Zeus and Hera asked him to settle the question of which sex, male or female, experienced more pleasure during [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]]. Zeus claimed it was women; Hera claimed it was men. When Tiresias sided with Zeus, Hera struck him blind.<ref name=":3" /> Since Zeus could not undo what she had done, he gave him the gift of prophecy.\n\nAn alternative and less commonly told story has it that Tiresias was blinded by [[Athena]] after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, [[Chariclo]], begged her to undo her curse, but Athena could not; she gave him a prophecy instead.\n\n====Chelone====\nAt the marriage of Zeus and Hera, a [[nymph]] named [[Chelone (Greek mythology)|Chelone]] was disrespectful or refused to attend the wedding. Zeus thus turned her into a [[tortoise]].\n\n====The Golden Fleece====\nHera hated [[Pelias]] because he had killed [[Sidero]], his step-grandmother, in one of the goddess\'s temples. She later convinced [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] to kill Pelias. The [[Golden Fleece]] was the item that Jason needed to get his mother freed.\n\n====Ixion====\nWhen [[Zeus]] had pity on [[Ixion]] and brought him to Olympus and introduced him to the gods, instead of being grateful, Ixion grew lustful for Hera. Zeus found out about his intentions and made a cloud in the shape of Hera, who was later named [[Nephele]], and tricked Ixion into coupling with it. From their union came [[Centaurus (Greek mythology)|Centaurus]]. So Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered [[Hermes]] to bind Ixion to a winged fiery wheel that was always spinning. Therefore, Ixion was bound to a burning solar wheel for all eternity, first spinning across the heavens, but in later myth transferred to [[Tartarus]].<ref>Kerenyi 1951, p.160</ref>\n\n===Children===\n{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;"\n|-\n!
