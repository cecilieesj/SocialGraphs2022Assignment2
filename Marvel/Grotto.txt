Naturally occurring grottoes are often small caves near water that are usually flooded or liable to flood at [[high tide]]. Sometimes, artificial grottoes are used as [[garden feature]]s. The \'\'[[Blue Grotto (Capri)|Grotta Azzurra]]\'\' at [[Capri]] and the grotto at [[Tiberius]]\' [[Villa Jovis]] in the [[Bay of Naples]] are examples of popular natural seashore grottoes.\n\nWhether in tidal water or high up in hills, grottoes are generally made up of [[limestone]] [[geology]], where the acidity of standing water has [[Solvation|dissolved]] the [[carbonate]]s in the [[rock matrix]] as it passes through what were originally small fissures.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n{{Wiktionary|grotto}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \'\'grotto\'\' comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] \'\'grotta\'\', [[Vulgar Latin]] \'\'grupta\'\', and [[Latin]] \'\'crypta\'\' ("a [[crypt]]").<ref>\'\'[[OED]]\'\', \'\'s.v.\'\' "grotto".</ref>  It is also related by an historical accident to the word \'\'grotesque\'\'. In the late 15th century, Romans accidentally unearthed [[Nero]]\'s \'\'[[Domus Aurea]]\'\' on the [[Palatine Hill]], a series of rooms, decorated with designs of garlands, slender architectural framework, foliage, and animals. The rooms had sunk underground over time. The Romans who discovered this historical monument found it very strange, partly because it was uncovered from an "underworld" source. This led the Romans of that era to give it the name \'\'grottesca\'\', from which came the French \'\'[[grotesque]]\'\'.\n\n==Antiquity==\n[[File:طاق بستان 1.jpg|thumb|Two vaulted grottoes called [[Taq-e Bostan]], located in Iran, [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] era]]\nGrottoes were very popular in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture. Spring-fed grottoes were a feature of Apollo\'s oracles at [[Delphi]], [[Corinth]], and [[Clarus]].<ref>G. W. Elderkin, "The Natural and the Artificial Grotto", \'\'Hesperia\'\' \'\'\'10\'\'\'.2 (April – June 1941), pp. 125–137, gives numerous well-known ancient Greek examples, natural and architectural, with some details of their sites.</ref> The [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] city of [[Rhodes]] was designed with rock-cut artificial grottoes incorporated into the city, made to look natural.<ref>E. E. Rice, "Grottoes on the Acropolis of Hellenistic Rhodes", \'\'The Annual of the British School at Athens\'\' \'\'\'90\'\'\' (1995), pp. 383–404.</ref> At the great Roman sanctuary of [[Palestrina|Praeneste]] south of Rome, the oldest portion of the primitive sanctuary was situated on the second lowest terrace, in a grotto in the natural rock where a spring developed into a well. According to tradition, Praeneste\'s sacred spring had a native [[nymph]], who was honored in a grotto-like watery [[nymphaeum]].<ref>A.R.A. van Aken, "Some Aspects of Nymphaea in Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia" \'\'[[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]]\'\', Fourth Series, \'\'\'4\'\'\'.3/4 (1951), pp. 272–284</ref>\n\n[[Tiberius]], the Roman emperor, filled his grotto at [[Sperlonga]] with sculptures to create a sense of mythology, perhaps channeling [[Polyphemus]]\' cave in the \'\'[[Odyssey]]\'\'. The [[numinous]] quality of the grotto is still more ancient: in a grotto near [[Knossos]] in Crete, [[Eileithyia]] was venerated, even before [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace-building. Even farther back in time, the [[immanence]] of the divine in a grotto is seen in the sacred caves of [[Lascaux]].\n\n==Cellars in Ticino==\n[[File:Cevio Grotti, Maggiatal 1.JPG|thumb|Grotto in [[Cevio]]]]\nIn [[Ticino]], the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, grottoes were places where wine and food was stored and preserved. They were built by exploiting the morphology of rocks and boulders, to create rooms with a cool climate suitable for food, particularly milk and cheese, as well as potatoes, sausages and wine storage.<ref>{{Cite web\n | url           = https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220529-switzerlands-ingenious-cooling-caves\n | title         = Switzerland\'s ingenious cooling caves\n | language      = en\n | work          = [[BBC_Online#International-only_site|BBC Travel]]\n | date          = 2022-03-30\n | access-date   = 2022-06-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n | url           = https://www.lebendige-traditionen.ch/dam/tradition/de/dokumente/tradition/ti/cultura_dei_grottinellasvizzeraitaliana.pdf.download.pdf/cultura_dei_grottinellasvizzeraitaliana.pdf\n | title         = Grotto culture in Italian Switzerland\n | language      = it\n | format        = PDF\n | work          = Living Traditions of Switzerland\n | publisher     = Swiss Confederation\n | date          = 2018\n | access-date   = 2022-06-07\n}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of these cellars is demonstrated in their number; for example there are 40 grotti in [[Maggia (municipality)|Maggia]], and no fewer in [[Moghegno]], and about 70 in [[Cevio]] behind Case Franzoni. Some grotti have been opened to the public, as in [[Avegno, Switzerland|Avegno]], but most have lost their original character as they became rustic restaurants which serve basic local food and drink. A true grotto is dug out under a rock or between two boulders, where subterranean air currents  keep the room cool. Often a grotto had a second floor with another one or two rooms for the fermentation cask and tools of the vintage. In front of the grotto were a table and benches of stone, where the farmers could rest and refresh themselves.<ref name="schweiz">{{Cite journal\n | date          = 1999\n | title         = Im Vorgarten zum Paradies\n | language      = \n | journal       = Schweiz.

Two famous grottoes in the [[Boboli Gardens]] of [[Palazzo Pitti]] were begun by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] and completed by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati|Ammanati]] and [[Bernardo Buontalenti|Buontalenti]] between 1583 and 1593. One of these grottoes originally housed the \'\'Prisoners\'\' of [[Michelangelo]]. Before the Boboli grotto, a garden was laid out by [[Niccolò Tribolo]] at the Medici [[Niccolò Tribolo|Villa Castello]], near [[Florence]]. At [[Villa di Pratolino|Pratolino]], in spite of the dryness of the site, there was a Grotto of Cupid (surviving), with water tricks for the unsuspecting visitor.<ref>Webster Smith, "Pratolino", \'\'The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians\'\' \'\'\'20\'\'\'.4 (December 1961), pp. 155–168</ref> The [[Fonte di Fata Morgana]] ("Fata Morgana\'s Spring") at Grassina, not far from Florence, is a small garden building, built in 1573–74 as a garden feature in the extensive grounds of the Villa "Riposo" (rest) of Bernardo Vecchietti. It is decorated with sculptures in the [[Giambologna]]n manner.\n\nThe outsides of garden grottoes are often designed to look like an enormous rock, a rustic porch or a rocky overhang. Inside, they are decorated as a temple or with fountains, [[stalactites]] and imitation gems and shells (sometimes made in ceramic); herms and mermaids, mythological subjects suited to the space; and [[naiad]]s, or river gods whose urns spilled water into pools.  Damp grottoes were cool places to retreat from the Italian sun, but they also became fashionable in the cool drizzle of the [[Île-de-France]]. In [[Kuskovo]] in the Sheremetev estate there is a Summer Grotto, built in 1775.\n[[File:Villa torrigiani di lucca, statua 04.JPG|thumb|upright|Sculpture in a grotto setting, [[Villa Torrigiani]], Lucca]]\n\nGrottoes could also serve as baths; an example of this is at the [[Palazzo del Te]], in the \'Casino della Grotta\', where a small suite of intimate rooms is laid out around a grotto and \'\'loggetta\'\' (covered balcony). Courtiers once bathed in the small cascade that splashed over the pebbles and shells encrusted in the floor and walls.\n\nGrottoes have also served as [[chapel]]s, or at [[Villa Farnese]] at Caprarola, a little theater designed in the grotto manner. They were often combined with cascading fountains in Renaissance gardens.\n\nThe grotto designed by [[Bernard Palissy]] for [[Catherine de\' Medici]]\'s château in [[Paris, France|Paris]], the [[Tuileries]], was renowned. There are also grottoes in the gardens designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] for [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. In England, an early garden grotto was built at [[Wilton House]] in the 1630s, probably by [[Isaac de Caus]].\n\nGrottoes were suitable for less formal gardens too. [[Pope\'s Grotto]], created by [[Alexander Pope]], is almost all that survives of one of the first [[Landscape architecture|landscape gardens]] in England, at [[Twickenham]].<ref>Frederick Bracher, "Pope\'s Grotto: The Maze of Fancy Pope\'s Grotto: The Maze of Fancy", \'\'The Huntington Library Quarterly\'\' \'\'\'12\'\'\'.2 (February 1949), pp. 141–162; Anthony Beckles Willson, "Alexander Pope\'s Grotto in Twickenham", \'\'Garden History\'\' \'\'\'26\'\'\'.1 (Summer, 1998), pp. 31–59</ref> Pope was inspired after seeing grottoes in Italy during a visit there.

In the 19th century, when miniature [[Matterhorn]]s and rock-gardens became fashionable, a grotto was often found, such as at [[Ascott House]]. In Bavaria, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig]]\'s [[Linderhof]] contains an abstraction of the grotto under Venusberg, which figured in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]\'s \'\'[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]\'\'.\n\nAlthough grottoes have largely fallen from fashion since the British [[Picturesque]] movement, architects and artists occasionally try to redefine the grotto in contemporary design works. Such examples include [[Frederick Kiesler]]\'s \'\'Grotto of Meditation for New Harmony\'\' (1964),<ref>{{cite news |author=Alderslade, Jessica |date=2014 |title=An Introduction to the Grotto and Its Place within Contemporary Design |work=Reinterpreting the Grotto in Contemporary Design |location=Australia}}</ref> ARM\'st post-modern \'\'Storey Hall\'\' (1995), Aranda/Lasch\'s \'\'Grotto Concept,\'\' (2005), Callum Moreton\'s \'\'Grotto\'\' pavilion (2010), and [[Antonino Cardillo]]\'s \'\'Grottoes\'\' series (2013–2016).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cardillo |first=Antonino |date=April 19, 2018 |title=Grottoes |url=https://www.antoninocardillo.com/works/grottoes/ |url-status=live |access-date=June 7, 2022 |website=www.antoninocardillo.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Religious grottoes ==\n[[File:Marian grotto with a lily pond in San Thome Basilica, Chennai.jpg|thumb|Marian grotto with a lily pond in [[San Thome Basilica|San Thome Basilica, Chennai]]]]\n[[File:Gua Maria Gereja Santa.jpg|thumb|Modern Marian grotto at a church in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]\nToday, artificial grottoes are purchased and built for ornamental and devotional purposes. They are often used as [[shrine]]s in which to place statues of saints, particularly the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], in outdoor gardens.\n\nMany [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] visit a grotto where [[Bernadette Soubirous]] saw apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Numerous garden shrines are modelled after these apparitions. They can commonly be found displayed in gardens and [[church architecture|churches]], among other places (see [[Lourdes grotto]]).\n\nThe largest grotto is believed to be the [[Grotto of the Redemption]] in [[West Bend, Iowa]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Grotto in an iceberg, Herbert George Ponting, original.jpg|Grotto in an [[iceberg]] with the \'\'[[Terra Nova (ship)|Terra Nova]]\'\' ship in the background (1911) during the \'British Antarctic Expedition\' by [[Herbert G.
