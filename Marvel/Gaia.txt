Walker (author)|Walker]], claim that Gaia as Mother Earth is a later form of a [[Neolithic Europe|pre-Indo-European]] [[Mother goddess|Great Mother]], venerated in [[Neolithic]] times. Her existence is a speculation and controversial in the academic community. Some modern mythographers, including [[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi]], [[Carl A. P. Ruck|Ruck]], and [[Danny Staples|Staples]], interpret the goddesses [[Demeter]] the "mother", [[Persephone]] the "daughter", and [[Hecate]] the "crone", as aspects of a former great goddess identified by some{{who|date=April 2012}} as [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] or as Gaia herself. In [[Crete]], a goddess was worshiped as \'\'[[Potnia Theron]]\'\' (the "Mistress of the Animals") or simply [[Potnia]] ("Mistress"), speculated{{by whom|date=April 2012}} as Rhea or Gaia; the title was later applied in Greek texts to [[Artemis]]. The mother goddess [[Cybele]] from [[Anatolia]] (modern [[Turkey]]) was partly identified by the Greeks with Gaia, but more so with Rhea.[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aion (deity)|Aion]] and [[Tellus Mater]] with Carpi, infant deities of the fruit of the seasons, in a mosaic from a Roman villa in [[Sentinum]], first half of the third century BC, ([[Munich]] Glyptothek, Inv.

The hypothesis proposes that living organisms and inorganic material are part of a [[dynamical systems|dynamical system]] that shapes the Earth\'s [[biosphere]], and maintains the Earth as a fit environment for life. In some Gaia theory approaches, the Earth itself is viewed as an organism with self-regulatory functions.
