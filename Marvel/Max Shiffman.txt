Shiffman gave a one-hour address at a meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. He was an instructor at CCNY in 1939–42. In 1942 at NYU he joined a research project funded by the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]]. From 1945 to 1948 he was an associate professor at NYU, where he influenced many graduate students, including [[Clifford Gardner]], [[Joe Keller]], [[Martin Kruskal]], [[Peter Lax]], [[Cathleen Morawetz]], and [[Louis Nirenberg]]. In 1948 [[Gábor Szegő]] hired Shiffman as a full professor at [[Stanford University]].<ref name=Lax/> Szegő also brought to the Stanford mathematics department [[Donald C.

He recovered and continued his research and teaching until a second breakdown in 1956. With the support of his friends and a generous trustee of Stanford University, he was admitted to [[Chestnut Lodge]], a prestigious psychiatric institute. After nine years of therapy he was transferred to [[Agnews Developmental Center|Agnews State Hospital]] in California, where Max took advantage of a state law and sued in court to be released; he convinced a jury that he was mentally competent.<ref name=Lax/>}}\n\nFrom 1965 to 1967 Shiffman held at Stanford a research appointment, mainly due to the efforts of Donald C. Spencer. At [[California State University, Hayward]] Shiffman was a full professor from 1967 to 1981, when he retired as professor emeritus.<ref name=Lax/>\n\n{{blockquote|Much of Shiffman’s work dealt with Plateau’s problem. He showed that if a boundary curve spans two minimal surfaces that are relative minima, then it also spans one which is not a relative minimum. In one of his last publications he showed that a doubly connected minimal surface whose boundary consists of two circles on parallel planes intersects any other parallel plane in a circle. Shiffman also worked on problems of conformal mapping, and the differentiability and analyticity of solutions of double integral variational problems. ... Shiffman used variational methods to study the flow of fluids, incompressible and compressible. He proved a basic theorem about compressible flows around bodies with prescribed subsonic speed at infinity; he showed that such flows are smooth until the flow becomes sonic. The technical tool he used, altering the equation of state, is called “shiffmanization” by cognoscenti.<ref name=Lax/>}}\n\nIn the summer of 1949 Shiffman gave a new proof of [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]\'s [[minimax theorem]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Shiffman, M.|title=On the equality min man=max min, and the theory of games|journal=Rand Report RM-243|year=1949}}</ref> with a generalization to concave-convex functions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVCflvTPYE8C&pg=PA313|title = Introduction to Matrix Analysis: Second Edition|isbn = 9780898713992|last1 = Bellman|first1 = Richard|date = December 1997|page=313}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QVCflvTPYE8C&pg=PA314 p. 314]</ref> [[Maurice Sion]] generalized Shiffman\'s result to [[Sion\'s minimax theorem]], published in 1958.\n\nIn 1938 Bella Manel, a mathematics graduate student at NYU, married Max Shiffman.
