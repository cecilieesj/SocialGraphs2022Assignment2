The book is the basis for two films: \'\'[[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|Fever Pitch]]\'\' (1997, UK) and \'\'[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]\'\' (2005, U.S.). The first edition was subtitled "A Fan\'s Life", but later paperback editions were not.\n\n== Book ==\n\'\'Fever Pitch\'\', first published in 1992, is a memoir and Hornby\'s second book. It tells the story of the author\'s relationship with [[association football|football]], and with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]] in particular.<ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Pete|title=BOOK REVIEW / A twerp\'s best moment ever: \'Fever Pitch\' - Nick Hornby: Gollancz|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/book-review--a-twerps-best-moment-ever-fever-pitch--nick-hornby-gollancz-1399-1550897.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 September 1992}}</ref> It consists of several chapters in chronological order, from the time the author first became a football fan as a child until his early thirties. Each chapter is about a football match that he remembers watching, most but not all at [[Arsenal Stadium]], Highbury, and how it related to the events that were going on with his life. As well as recounting Arsenal\'s highs and lows, Hornby talks about other football clubs that play in London, and his interest in the contrasting surroundings of [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] and [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]], whose matches he attends while at university.\n\n\'\'Fever Pitch\'\' sold over a million copies in the United Kingdom.{{cn|date=September 2022}} It won the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] in 1992 and was reprinted with a new cover and made available as part of the 2005–06 [[Arsenal F.C.]] membership pack as part of the "Final Salute" to Highbury Stadium.{{cn|date=September 2022}} The book was made a [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] Modern Classic in August 2012.\n\n==Adaptations==\n=== 1997 film ===\n{{main|Fever Pitch (1997 film)}}\nA 1997 film version of \'\'Fever Pitch\'\', with a screenplay adapted by Hornby, fictionalised the story, concentrating on Arsenal\'s [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship-winning season in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] and its effect on the protagonist\'s romantic relationship. Paul Ashworth, played by [[Colin Firth]], the character based on Hornby, a teacher at a school in North London and his burgeoning romance with Sarah Hughes ([[Ruth Gemmell]]), a new teacher who joins Ashworth\'s school. The film culminates with Arsenal playing title rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Liverpool F.C. 0–2 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|final game of the season]] on 26 May 1989, in which a last minute [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] goal gives Arsenal the 2–0 win they need to win the title. \'\'Fever Pitch\'\' compares Hornby\'s life at Arsenal and other football clubs.\n\n=== 2005 film ===\n{{main|Fever Pitch (2005 film)}}\n\nA 2005 film remake of \'\'Fever Pitch\'\', directed by the [[Farrelly Brothers]] with Hornby as an executive producer, starred [[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. In this adaptation (based on the 1997 film, not the 1992 book), the action is moved from [[London]] to [[Boston]], the focus of the protagonist\'s obsession is shifted from [[Association football|football]] to [[baseball]] and the story is based on the 2004 [[Boston Red Sox]] season, which culminated with the team\'s first [[Major League Baseball]] [[World Series]] [[2004 World Series|victory]] in 86 years.  This championship was entirely coincidental; the 2005 version was being filmed during the 2004 regular season, including scenes filmed at [[Fenway Park]] during actual games. As the Red Sox continued to progress through the playoffs, the Farrellys rewrote the script to include the historic moment. The movie was renamed \'\'The Perfect Catch\'\' outside North America to avoid confusion with the 1997 film.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hawker|first1=Philippa|title=The Perfect Catch|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/reviews/the-perfect-catch/2005/09/07/1125772576383.html|website=The Age|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite news|author=Bentley, Nick. |title=Nick Hornby, \'\'Fever Pitch\'\'|work=Contemporary British Fiction|location=Edinburgh|publisher= Edinburgh University Press|date= 2008|pages= 117-24|isbn= 978-0-7486-2420-1}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/133_wbc_archive_new/page3.shtml Nick Hornby discusses \'\'Fever Pitch\'\'] on the BBC \'\'[[World Book Club]]\'\'\n\n{{Nick Hornby}}\n{{Arsenal F.C.}}\n\n[[Category:1992 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Works by Nick Hornby]]\n[[Category:Arsenal F.C. mass media]]\n[[Category:Association football books]]\n[[Category:Autobiographies adapted into films]]\n[[Category:British autobiographies]]\n[[Category:Victor Gollancz Ltd books]]\n[[Category:William Hill Sports Book of the Year winning works]]'}]}}
