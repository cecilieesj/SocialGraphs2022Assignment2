Thus, he has been interpreted as being the "complete one" and also the finisher of the world, which he returns to watery chaos at the end of the creative cycle. As creator, he was seen as the progenitor of the world, the deities and universe having received his vital force or [[Ka (Egyptian soul)|ka]].<ref name="Wilkinson 99">Wilkinson, Richard H.

A product of the energy and matter contained in this chaos, he created his children—the first deities, out of loneliness. He produced from his own sneeze, or in some accounts, semen, [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]], the god of air, and [[Tefnut]], the goddess of moisture. The brother and sister, curious about the primeval waters that surrounded them, went to explore the waters and disappeared into the darkness. Unable to bear his loss, Atum sent a fiery messenger, the [[Eye of Ra]], to find his children. The tears of joy he shed upon their return were the first human beings.<ref>Pinch, Geraldine (2004). \'\'Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of Ancient Egypt.\'\' Oxford University Press. pp. 63–64</ref>\n\n== Iconography ==\n\nAtum is usually depicted as a man wearing either the [[nemes|royal head-cloth]] or the dual [[Hedjet|white]] and [[Deshret|red crown]] of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], reinforcing his connection with kingship. Sometimes he is also shown as a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], the form he returns to at the end of the creative cycle, and also occasionally as a [[mongoose]], [[lion]], [[Bull (mythology)|bull]], [[lizard]], or [[ape]].<ref name="Wilkinson 99"/>\n[[File:Obelisk-SesostrisI-Heliopolis.JPG|thumb|right|The Al-Masalla [[obelisk]], the largest surviving monument from Heliopolis|upright]]\n\n== Worship ==\n\nAtum\'s worship centered on the city of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: \'\'Annu\'\' or \'\'Iunu\'\').<ref name="Wilkinson 99"/> The only surviving remnant of Heliopolis is the Temple of Re-Atum [[Egyptian obelisk|obelisk]] located in Al-Masalla of [[Al-Matariyyah|Al-Matariyyah, Cairo]].
