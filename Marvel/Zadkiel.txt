In \'\'Maseket Azilut\'\' Zadkiel/Hasdiel is listed as co-chief with [[Gabriel]] of the order of \'\'Shinanim\'\'. As an angel of mercy, some texts claim that Zadkiel is the unnamed biblical [[Angel of the Lord]] who holds back [[Abraham]] to prevent the patriarch from sacrificing his son, and because of this is usually shown holding a dagger. Other texts cite [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] or \'\'Tadhiel\'\' or some other angel as the angel intended, while others interpret the Angel of the Lord as a [[theophany]].{{sfn|Lewis|Oliver|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=56B7fmmlt6QC&pg=PA388#v=snippet&q=Zadkiel&f=false 388]}}\n\nZadkiel is one of two standard bearers (along with [[Jophiel]]) who follow directly behind Michael as the head archangel enters battle. Zadkiel is associated with the color [[violet (color)|violet]]. In iconography, he is often depicted holding a knife or dagger.\n\nIn [[Jewish]] [[mysticism]] and Western [[ritual magic]], Zadkiel is associated with the [[planet]] [[Jupiter]].{{sfn|Lewis|Oliver|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=56B7fmmlt6QC&pg=PA304#v=snippet&q=Zadkiel&f=false 304]}} The angel\'s position in the [[Sephirot]] is fourth, which corresponds to mercy.{{sfn|Davidson|1967}}<!--(If anyone knows his symbols [i.e, a book, scroll, staff, etc.] please list them here)-->\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n* In japanese [[light novel]] series \'\'Date a Live\'\', Zadkiel is the name of a spiritual weapon (referred to as Angels within the series), belonging to Yoshino Himekawa.
