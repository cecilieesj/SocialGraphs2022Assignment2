Icarus and Daedalus attempt to escape from [[Crete]] by means of wings that Daedalus constructed from feathers and wax. Daedalus warns Icarus first of complacency and then of [[hubris]], instructing him to fly neither too low nor too high, lest the sea\'s dampness clog his wings or the sun\'s heat melt them. Icarus ignores Daedalus’s instructions not to fly too close to the sun, causing the wax in his wings to melt. He falls  out of the sky, plunges into the sea, and drowns. The myth gave rise to the idiom "[[wikt:fly too close to the sun|don\'t fly too close to the sun]]".\n\n== The legend ==\n[[File:Gaziantep Zeugma Museum Daedalus mosaic 1871.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daedalus]], Icarus, Queen [[Pasiphaë]], and two of her attendants in a [[Roman mosaic]] from [[Zeugma, Commagene]]]]\n[[File:Herbert Draper - The Lament for Icarus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|\'\'[[The Lament for Icarus]]\'\' (1898) by [[Herbert James Draper|H. J. Draper]]]]\nIcarus\'s father [[Daedalus]], a very talented [[Athens|Athenian]] craftsman, built the [[Cretan Labyrinth|Labyrinth]] for [[Minos|King Minos]] of Crete near his palace at [[Knossos]] to imprison the [[Minotaur]], a half-man, half-bull monster born of his wife and the [[Cretan bull]]. Minos imprisoned Daedalus himself in the labyrinth because he gave Minos\'s daughter, [[Ariadne]], a [[wikt:clew|clew]]<!--please do not change this to \'clue\'; it\'s a \'clew,\' a ball of string; see wiktionary link--><ref>[[wiktionary:clew|clew]]&nbsp;– a ball of yarn or thread. The etymology of the word "[[wiktionary:clue|clue]]" is a direct reference to this story of the Labyrinth.</ref> (or ball of string) in order to help [[Theseus]], the enemy of Minos, to survive the Labyrinth and defeat the Minotaur.\n\nDaedalus fashioned two pairs of wings out of wax and feathers for himself and his son. Daedalus tried his wings first. But before trying to escape the island, he warned his son not to fly too close to the sun, nor too close to the sea, but to follow his path of flight. (Daedalus --in his warning-- said to Icarus, "For the fogs about the earth may weigh you down and the blaze from the sun are going to melt your feathers apart".) Overcome by giddiness while flying, Icarus (who disobeyed his father) soared into the sky trying to quench his thirst. But he came too close to the sun. And without warning, the [[heat]] (from the sun) melted the wax holding his feathers together. One by one, Icarus\'s feathers fell like snowflakes. Icarus kept flapping his "wings", but he had no feathers left and was only flapping his bare arms. Then he fell into the sea and drowned. Daedalus wept for his son and called the nearest land [[Icaria]] (an island southwest of [[Samos]]) in the  memory of him. Today, the supposed site of his burial on the island bears his name, and the sea near Icaria in which he drowned is called the [[Icarian Sea]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Graves|author-link=Robert Graves|year=1955|title=[[The Greek Myths]]|chapter=92&nbsp;– Daedalus and Talus|isbn=0-14-007602-6}}</ref><ref>[[Thomas Bullfinch]] - The Age of Fable Stories of Gods and Heroes [http://www.kundaliniawakeningsystems1.com/downloads/thomas-bulfinchs-mythology-age-of-fable-vols1&2.pdf \'\'KundaliniAwakeningSystem.com\'\'] & The Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C.
