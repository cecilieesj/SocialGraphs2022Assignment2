He was sent to retrieve it for [[Admete]], the daughter of King [[Eurystheus]].<ref>[[Euripides]], \'\'[[Herakles (Euripides)|Herakles]]\'\', 408 \'\'sqq\'\'.</ref><ref>Apollonius Rhodius, \'\'Argonautica\'\', II. 777 \'\'sqq\'\'. and 966 \'\'sqq\'\'.</ref><ref>Diodorus Siculus, \'\'Bibliotheca Historica\'\', IV. 16</ref><ref>Ps.-Apollodorus, \'\'Bibliotheke\'\', II. 5. 9</ref><ref>Pausanias, \'\'Hellados Periegesis\'\', V. 10. 9</ref><ref>Quintus Smyrnaeus, \'\'Posthomerica\'\', VI. 240 \'\'sqq\'\'.</ref><ref name="auto">Hyginus, \'\'Fabulae\'\', 30</ref> Most versions of the myth indicate that Hippolyta was so impressed with Heracles that she gave him the belt without argument, perhaps while visiting him on his ship. Then, according to [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], the goddess [[Hera]], making herself appear as one of the Amazons, spread a rumour among them that Heracles and his crew were abducting their queen, so the Amazons attacked the ship. In the fray that followed, Heracles slew Hippolyta, stripped her of the belt, fought off the attackers, and sailed away.\n\n=== Adventure of Theseus ===\nIn the myth of [[Theseus]], the hero joined Heracles in his expedition, or went on a separate expedition later, and was actually the one who had the encounter with Hippolyta. Some versions say he abducted her, some that Heracles did the abducting but gave her to Theseus as spoils, and others say that she fell in love with Theseus and betrayed the Amazons by willingly leaving with him. In any case, she was taken to Athens where she was wed to Theseus. In some renditions the other Amazons became enraged at the marriage and attacked Athens. This was the [[Attic War]], in which they were defeated by Athenian forces under Theseus or Heracles. In other renditions Theseus later put Hippolyta aside to marry [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]. So Hippolyta rallied her Amazons to attack the wedding ceremony. When the defenders closed the doors on the attackers, either Hippolyta was killed, Theseus directly killed her in the fight, she was accidentally killed by another Amazon, [[Molpadia]], while fighting by Theseus\' side, or was accidentally killed by her sister [[Penthesilea]] during this battle or in a separate incident. This killer was in turn slain by Theseus or [[Achilles]]. Some stories paint Theseus in a more favorable light, saying that Hippolyta was dead before he and Phaedra were wed, and this battle did not occur. Further complicating the narratives, a number of ancient writers say the Amazon in question was not Hippolyta at all, but her sister [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], [[Melanippe]], or [[Glauce]]. Moreover, there are combined versions of the tale in which Heracles abducts and kills Hippolyta while Theseus, assisted by [[Sthenelus]] and [[Telamon]], abducts and marries Antiope. There are also stories that Hippolyta or Antiope later bore Theseus a son, [[Hippolytus of Athens]].<ref>Isocrates, \'\'Orations\'\', XII. 193</ref><ref>Diodorus Siculus, \'\'Bibliotheca Historica\'\', II. 46. 5, IV. 28 and 64</ref><ref>Ps.-Apollodorus, \'\'Bibliotheke\'\', I. 16-17, V. 1-2</ref><ref>Seneca, \'\'Hippolytus\'\', 927 \'\'sqq\'\'.</ref><ref>Plutarch, \'\'Theseus\'\', 26-28</ref><ref>Pausanias, \'\'Hellados Periegesis\'\', I. 2. 1, I. 15. 2, I. 41. 7, II. 32. 9, V. 11. 4 and 7</ref><ref>Quintus Smyrnaeus, \'\'Posthomerica\'\', I. 18 \'\'sqq\'\'., 227 \'\'sqq\'\'., 538 \'\'sqq\'\'.</ref><ref name="auto"/>\n\n== Shakespeare character ==\n[[File:Hippolyte wax.jpg|220px|thumbnail|A wax sculpture of Hippolyta at [[Samsun]].]]\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]\'s \'\'[[A Midsummer Night\'s Dream]]\'\', Hippolyta is engaged to Theseus, the duke of Athens. In Act I, Scene 1 she and he discuss their fast-approaching wedding, which will take place under the new moon in four days (I.i.2). Theseus declares to Hippolyta that, although he "wooed her with his sword," he will wed her "with pomp, with triumph, and with revelling" and promises to begin a celebration that will continue until the wedding (I.i.19).\n\nThe characterization of Hippolyta in \'\'A Midsummer Night\'s Dream\'\' (as well as that of Theseus), like many other mytho-historical characters found in Shakespeare\'s plays, is based on ancient biographical accounts found in [[Plutarch]]\'s work \'\'[[Parallel Lives]]\'\'. In \'\'The Life of Theseus\'\', according to Plutarch, it was Hippolyta who concluded a four month long war between Athens and the Amazons with a peace treaty, resulting in the marriage between Theseus and Hippolyta. The dramatic representation of Hippolyta and Theseus in \'\'A Midsummer Night\'s Dream\'\', however, is entirely a product of the playwright\'s imagination.\n\nThe character of Hippolyta also appears in \'\'[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]\'\', a play co-written by Shakespeare and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]].\n\n== Classical literature sources ==\nChronological listing of classical literature sources for Hippolyte\'s belt:\n\n* Homer, \'\'Iliad\'\' 2. 649 ff (trans.
