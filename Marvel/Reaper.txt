Usually the crop involved is a [[cereal]] grass. The first documented reaping machines were Gallic reapers that were used in  Roman times in what would become modern-day France. The Gallic reaper involved a comb which collected the heads, with an operator knocking the grain into a box for later [[threshing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnrtr.com/Generator.html?pi=208&cp=3|title=The History of the Gallic Reaper|last=Chuksin|first=Petr|website=History of Gallic Reaper}}</ref> \n\nMost modern mechanical reapers cut the [[Poaceae|grass]]; most also gather it, either by [[windrow]]ing it or picking it up. Modern machines that not only cut and gather the grass but also [[threshing|thresh]] its seeds (the [[grain]]), [[winnowing|winnow]] the grain, and deliver it to a truck or wagon it are called [[combine harvester]]s or simply combines; they are the engineering descendants of earlier reapers.\n\n[[Hay]] is harvested somewhat differently from grain; in modern [[haymaking]], the machine that cuts the grass is called a hay [[mower]] or, if integrated with a [[conditioner (farming)|conditioner]], a mower-conditioner. As a [[manual labour|manual task]], cutting of both grain and hay may be called reaping, involving [[scythe]]s, [[sickle]]s, and [[grain cradle|cradles]], followed by differing downstream steps. Traditionally all such cutting could be called reaping, although a distinction between \'\'reaping\'\' of grain grasses and \'\'mowing\'\' of hay grasses has long existed; it was only after a decade of attempts at combined grain reaper/hay mower machines (1830s to 1840s) that designers of mechanical implements began resigning them to separate classes.<ref name="McCormick_1931_pp59-60">{{Harvnb|McCormick|1931|pp=59–60}}.</ref>\n\nMechanical reapers substantially changed agriculture from their appearance in the 1830s until the 1860s through 1880s, when they evolved into related machines, often called by different names (self-raking reaper, harvester, [[reaper-binder]], grain binder, binder), that collected and bound the [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] of grain with [[wire]] or [[twine]].<ref name="McCormick_1931_pp67-72">{{Harvnb|McCormick|1931|pp=67–72}}.</ref>\n\n==Hand reaping==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H0813-0600-035, bei Oranienburg, Roggenfeld wird mit Sense gemäht.jpg|thumb|A reaper cutting [[rye]] in Germany in 1949]]\n\nHand reaping is done by various means, including plucking the ears of grains directly by hand, cutting the grain stalks with a [[sickle]], cutting them with a [[scythe]], or a scythe fitted with a [[grain cradle]].  Reaping is usually distinguished from \'\'[[Mower|mowing]]\'\', which uses similar implements, but is the traditional term for cutting grass for hay, rather than reaping [[cereal]]s. The stiffer, dryer [[straw]] of the cereal plants and the greener grasses for hay usually demand different blades on the machines.\n\nThe reaped grain stalks are gathered into [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] (bunches), tied with string or with a twist of straw.  Several sheaves are then leant against each other with the ears off the ground to dry out, forming a [[stook]].  After drying, the sheaves are gathered from the field and stacked, being placed with the ears inwards, then covered with [[thatch]] or a [[tarpaulin]]; this is called a \'\'stack\'\' or \'\'rick\'\'.  In the [[British Isles]] a rick of sheaves is traditionally called a \'\'corn rick\'\', to distinguish it from a \'\'hay rick\'\' ("corn" in [[British English]] retains its older [[word sense|sense]] of "[[grain]]" generally, not "[[maize]]").  Ricks are made in an area inaccessible to livestock, called a \'\'rick-yard\'\' or \'\'stack-yard\'\'.  The corn-rick is later broken down and the sheaves [[threshing|threshed]] to separate the grain from the straw.\n\nCollecting spilt grain from the field after reaping is called \'\'[[gleaning]]\'\', and is traditionally done either by hand, or by penning animals such as [[chicken]]s or [[pig]]s onto the field.\n\nHand reaping is now rarely done in industrialized countries, but is still the normal method where machines are unavailable or where access for them is limited (such as on narrow terraces).\n\nThe more or less skeletal figure of a reaper with a scythe – known as the "Grim Reaper" – is a common [[Death (personification)|personification of death]] in many Western traditions and cultures. In this metaphor, death harvests the living, like a farmer harvests the crops.\n\n==Mechanical reaping==\nA mechanical reaper or reaping machine is a mechanical, semi-automated device that harvests crops.  Mechanical reapers and their descendant machines have been an important part of [[mechanised agriculture|mechanized agriculture]] and a main feature of [[agricultural productivity]].\n\n===Mechanical reapers in the U.S.===\nThe 19th century saw several inventors in the United States claim innovation in mechanical reapers. The various designs competed with each other, and were the subject of several lawsuits.<ref name="McCormick_1931">{{Harvnb|McCormick|1931}}.</ref>\n\n[[Obed Hussey]] in Ohio patented a reaper in 1833, the \'\'Hussey Reaper\'\'.<ref name="cheap">{{cite book |editor=Follet L.

The new reaper only required two [[horse]]s working in a non-strenuous manner, a man to work the machine, and another person to drive. In addition, the Hussey Reaper left an even and clean surface after its use.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Colman|first=Gould P. |title= Innovation and Diffusion in Agriculture |journal=Agricultural History |volume=42 |date=July 1968|pages=173–188}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cyrus McCormick\'s reaper.jpg|thumb|[[Cyrus McCormick|McCormick\'s]] reaper at a presentation in Virginia]]\nThe \'\'McCormick Reaper\'\' was designed by [[Robert Hall McCormick|Robert McCormick]] in [[Cyrus McCormick Farm|Walnut Grove]], [[Virginia]].

Over the next few decades the Hussey and McCormick reapers would compete with each other in the marketplace, despite being quite similar. By the 1850s, the original patents of both Hussey and McCormick had expired and many other manufacturers put similar machines on the market.<ref>Canine, Craig. \'\'Dream Reaper: The Story of an Old-Fashioned Inventor in the High-Tech, High-Stakes World of Modern Agriculture.\'\' New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1995. Pages 29-45.</ref>\n\nIn 1861, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] issued a ruling on the invention of the polarizing reaper design. It was determined that the money made from reapers was in large part due to Obed Hussey. S.T. Shubert, the acting commissioner of patents, declared that Hussey\'s improvements were the foundation of their success. It was ruled that the heirs of Obed Hussey would be monetarily compensated for his hard work and innovation by those who had made money from the reaper. It was also ruled that McCormick\'s reaper patent would be renewed for another 7 years.<ref name="cheap"/>\n\nAlthough the McCormick reaper was a revolutionary innovation for the harvesting of crops, it did not experience mainstream success and acceptance until at least 20 years after it was patented by Cyrus McCormick. This was because the McCormick reaper lacked a quality unique to Obed Hussey\'s reaper. Hussey\'s reaper used a sawlike cutter bar that cut stalks far more effectively than McCormick\'s. Only once Cyrus McCormick was able to acquire the rights to Hussey\'s cutter-bar mechanism (around 1850) did a truly revolutionary machine emerge.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Olmstead|first=Alan L. |title=The Mechanization of Reaping and Mowing in American Agriculture |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=35 |issue=2 |date=June 1975|page=327 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700075082}}</ref> Other factors in the gradual uptake of mechanized reaping included natural cultural conservatism among farmers (proven tradition versus new and unknown machinery); the poor state of many new farm fields, which were often littered with rocks, stumps, and areas of uneven soil, making the lifespan and operability of a reaping machine questionable; and some amount of fearful [[Luddite fallacy|Luddism]] among farmers that the machine would take away jobs, most especially among hired [[manual labour]]ers.<ref name="PrippsMorland1993p17">{{Citation |last=Pripps |first=Robert N. |last2=Morland |first2=Andrew (photographer) |year=1993 |title=Farmall Tractors: History of International McCormick-Deering Farmall Tractors |series=Farm Tractor Color History Series |publisher=MBI |location=Osceola, WI, USA |isbn=978-0-87938-763-1 |postscript=, p. 17.}}</ref>\n\nAnother strong competitor in the industry was the Manny Reaper by [[John Henry Manny]] and the companies that succeeded him. Even though McCormick has sometimes been simplistically credited as the [sole] "inventor" of the [[Reaper#Mechanical reapers in the U.S.|mechanical reaper]], a more accurate statement is that he independently reinvented aspects of it, created a crucial original integration of enough aspects to make a successful whole, and benefited from the influence of more than two decades of work by his father, as well as the aid of Jo Anderson, a slave held by his family.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jo Anderson|url=http://www.richmond.com/special-section/black-history/article_277b0072-700a-11e2-bb3d-001a4bcf6878.html|access-date=22 April 2015|newspaper=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date=5 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Reapers in the late 19th and 20th century===\n[[File:Champion Trade Card, 1875.jpg|thumb|Champion reaper, [[trade card]] from 1875]]\n[[File:Feature.
