It forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a [[Liquefaction|liquefied]] soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upward flowing water (as from an [[Artesian aquifer|artesian spring]]). In the case of upward flowing water, [[effective stress| forces]] oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles.\n\nThe saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy.\n\n[[Soil liquefaction]] may occur in partially saturated soil when it is shaken by an [[earthquake]] or similar forces. The movement combined with an increase in [[pore pressure]] (of groundwater) leads to the loss of particle [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]], causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink.\n\n== Properties ==\n[[File:Stuck in Quicksand (13944309974).jpg|thumb|A group of hikers encountering quicksand on the banks of the [[Paria River]], Utah]]\n[[File:Quicksandwarning.JPG|thumb|Quicksand warning sign near [[Lower King, Western Australia|Lower King]] Bridge, Western Australia]]\nQuicksand is a [[shear thinning]] [[non-Newtonian fluid]]: when undisturbed, it often appears to be [[phase (matter)|solid]] ("[[gel]]" form), but a less than 1% change in the [[stress (physics)|stress]] on the quicksand will cause a sudden decrease in its [[viscosity]] ("[[sol (colloid)|sol]]" form). After an initial disturbance—such as a person attempting to walk on it—the water and sand in the quicksand separate and dense regions of sand [[sediment]] form; it is because of the formation of these high [[volume fraction]] regions that the viscosity of the quicksand seems to decrease suddenly. Someone stepping on it will start to sink. To move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient [[pressure]] on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to [[liquefaction|liquefy]] it. The [[force]]s required to do this are quite large: to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of 1&nbsp;cm/s would require the same amount of force as that needed to lift a car.<ref name="Bonn">Khaldoun, A., E.

Quicksand has a density of about 2 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas the density of the human body is only about 1 gram per cubic centimeter. At that level of density, sinking beyond about waist height in quicksand is impossible. Even objects with a higher density than quicksand will float on it if stationary. Aluminium, for example, has a density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter, but a piece of aluminium will float on top of quicksand until motion causes the sand to liquefy.<ref name=Bakalar>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/quicksand-science-why-it-traps-how-to-escape/ |title=Quicksand Science: Why It Traps, How to Escape |first1=Nicholas |last1=Bakalar |publisher=[[National Geographic News]] |date=September 28, 2005 |access-date=October 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nContinued or panicked movement, however, may cause a person to sink further in the quicksand. Since this increasingly impairs movement, it can lead to a situation where other factors such as weather exposure (i.e. [[heat stroke|sun stroke]]), [[dehydration]], [[hypothermia]], [[drowning]] in a rising [[tide]] or predatory animals may harm a trapped person.<ref>[[Discovery Channel]]. \'\'[[MythBusters]]\'\'.
