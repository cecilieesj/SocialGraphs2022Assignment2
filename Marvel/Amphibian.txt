All living amphibians belong to the group [[Lissamphibia]]. They inhabit a wide variety of [[habitat]]s, with most species living within [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[fossorial]], [[arboreal]] or freshwater [[aquatic ecosystems]]. Thus amphibians typically start out as [[larva]]e living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.\n\nThe young generally undergo [[metamorphosis]] from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with [[lung]]s. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial [[salamander]]s and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to [[reptile]]s like [[lizard]]s but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are [[amniote]]s and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often [[ecological indicator]]s; in recent decades there has been a dramatic [[decline in amphibian populations]] for many species around the globe.\n\nThe earliest amphibians [[evolution of tetrapods|evolved]] in the [[Devonian]] period from [[sarcopterygian]] fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. The origin of modern amphibians belonging to Lissamphibia, which first appeared during the Early Triassic, around 250 million years ago, has long been contentious. However the emerging consensus is that they likely originated from [[temnospondyls]], the most diverse group of prehistoric amphibians, during the Permian period.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last1=Atkins |first1=Jade B. |last2=Reisz |first2=Robert R. |last3=Maddin |first3=Hillary C. |date=March 22, 2019 |title=Braincase simplification and the origin of lissamphibians |journal=PLOS ONE|language=en |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=e0213694 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0213694 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=6430379 |pmid=30901341 |quote=...there has been a growing consensus that lissamphibians are a monophyletic assemblage derived from within Temnospondyli, and more specifically from within the amphibamid dissorophoids.|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThe three modern orders of amphibians are [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (the frogs), [[Urodela]] (the salamanders), and [[caecilian|Apoda]] (the caecilians), a fourth group, the [[Albanerpetontidae]], became extinct around 2 million years ago.

Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a [[Cladistics#Three definitions of clade|stem-based or a node-based]] classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] have removed a large number of [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in [[Linnaean taxonomy]], and included them elsewhere under [[cladistic taxonomy]].<ref name=BlackburnWake>{{cite journal| author1=Blackburn, D.

The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=San Mauro, Diego |author2=Vences, Miguel |author3=Alcobendas, Marina |author4=Zardoya, Rafael |author5=Meyer, Axel |year=2005 |title=Initial diversification of living amphibians predated the breakup of Pangaea |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=590–599 |doi=10.1086/429523 |pmid=15795855 |s2cid=17021360 |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-33053 |access-date=November 10, 2016 |archive-date=February 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207031527/http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-33053 |url-status=live }}</ref> There are large gaps in the [[fossil record]], the discovery of the [[Dissorophoidea|dissorophoid]] temnospondyl [[Gerobatrachus hottoni|\'\'Gerobatrachus\'\']] from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs.<ref name="Anderson">{{cite journal |author1=Anderson, J. |author2=Reisz, R. |author3=Scott, D. |author4=Fröbisch, N. |author5=Sumida, S. |year=2008 |title=A stem batrachian from the Early Permian of Texas and the origin of frogs and salamanders |journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue=7194 |pages=515–518 |doi=10.1038/nature06865 |pmid=18497824 |bibcode=2008Natur.453..515A |s2cid=205212809 |url=https://www.academia.edu/13288317 |access-date=November 10, 2016 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714102942/https://www.academia.edu/13288317 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular analysis]] suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the [[Paleontology|palaeontological]] evidence indicates.<ref name="Anderson" /> One study suggested suggested that the last common ancestor of all modern amphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that [[Stereospondyli|stereospondyl]] temnospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170619151534.htm|title=Tiny fossils reveal backstory of the most mysterious amphibian alive|website=ScienceDaily|access-date=June 28, 2017|archive-date=November 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105163759/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170619151534.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> However, most studies support a single [[monophyletic]] origin of all modern amphibians within the dissorophoid temnospondyls.<ref name=":2" />\n\nAs they evolved from lunged fish, amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land, including the need to develop new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their [[lateral line]] systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful [[ultraviolet]] rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843–859 }}\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe superclass [[Tetrapoda]] is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Terrestrial_Vertebrates/14952 |title=Terrestrial Vertebrates |author=Laurin, Michel |year=2011 |work=Tree of Life Web Project |access-date=September 16, 2012 |archive-date=March 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301091857/http://tolweb.org/Terrestrial_Vertebrates/14952 |url-status=live }}</ref> Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, some of which are impervious.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Amniota/14990 |title=Amniota |author1=Laurin, Michel |author2=Gauthier, Jacques A. |year=2012 |work=Tree of Life Web Project |access-date=September 16, 2012 |archive-date=June 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200601223227/http://tolweb.org/Amniota/14990 |url-status=live }}</ref> Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843–859 }} They are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in [[brackish water]] in [[mangrove]] swamps;<ref>{{cite book |title=Introduction to the Biology of Marine Life |last=Sumich |first=James L. |author2=Morrissey, John F. |year=2004 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-3313-1 |page=171 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8vTCze3dHgC&q=Amphibians |access-date=October 15, 2020 |archive-date=April 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414082908/https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8vTCze3dHgC&q=Amphibians |url-status=live }}</ref> the [[Anderson\'s salamander]] meanwhile occurs in brackish or salt water lakes.<ref>Brad Shaffer; Oscar Flores-Villela; Gabriela Parra-Olea; David Wake (2004).

Their [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully [[Ossification|ossified]] vertebrae with [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, [[Skin|poison glands]] (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=24–25 }} They supplement this with [[gas exchange]] through the skin.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843–859 }}\n\n=== Anura ===\n[[File:Red eyed tree frog edit2.jpg|thumb|alt=Red-eyed tree frog|[[Agalychnis callidryas|Red-eyed tree frog]] (\'\'Agalychnis callidryas\'\') with limbs and feet specialised for climbing]]\nThe order [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (from the Ancient Greek \'\'[[Privative a|a(n)-]]\'\' meaning "without" and \'\'oura\'\' meaning "tail") comprises the frogs and toads.

These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by [[hormone]]s secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish.

They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully [[ossification|ossified]] and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The [[pectoral girdle]] is supported by muscle, and the well-developed [[pelvic girdle]] is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }}\n\n[[File:Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton front.jpg|thumb|alt=Frog skeleton|Skeleton of the [[Surinam horned frog]]<br/>(\'\'Ceratophrys cornuta\'\')]]\nIn most amphibians, there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some salamanders have fewer digits and the [[amphiuma]]s are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The [[Siren (genus)|sirens]] are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26–36 }}\n\nIn frogs, the hind legs are larger than the fore legs, especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} Some salamanders in the genus \'\'[[Aneides]]\'\' and certain [[lungless salamander|plethodontids]] climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails.<ref name="BritCaudata" /> In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[ventral fin|ventral]] fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion.

In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation is similar to that of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the [[pulmonary artery]] to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=306 }}\n\n=== Nervous and sensory systems ===\n{{see also|Pain in amphibians}}\nThe [[nervous system]] is basically the same as in other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body.

Some caecilians possess [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]] that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular [[Tympanum (anatomy)|eardrum]] lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the [[stapes]], to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} There is a patch of specialized haircells, called \'\'papilla amphibiorum\'\', in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds.

Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by [[inertia]]. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short [[Esophagus|oesophagus]] is lined with [[Cilium|cilia]] that help to move the food to the stomach and [[mucus]] produced by glands in the mouth and [[pharynx]] eases its passage. The enzyme [[chitinase]] produced in the stomach helps digest the [[chitin]]ous cuticle of arthropod prey.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}\n\nAmphibians possess a [[pancreas]], [[liver]] and [[gall bladder]]. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is determined by its function as a [[glycogen]] and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. [[Adipose tissue]] is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=66 }}\n<!--In aquatic amphibians, the liver plays only a small role in processing nitrogen for excretion, and [[ammonia]] is diffused mainly through the skin. The liver of terrestrial amphibians converts ammonia to urea, a less toxic, water-soluble nitrogenous compound, as a means of water conservation. In some species, urea is further converted into [[uric acid]]. [[Bile]] secretions from the liver collect in the gall bladder and flow into the small intestine. In the small intestine, enzymes digest carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Salamanders lack a valve separating the small intestine from the large intestine. Salt and water absorption occur in the large intestine, as well as mucous secretion to aid in the transport of faecal matter, which is passed out through the [[cloaca]].<ref name="Anatomy" />---Omitting this until a more reliable source can be found.--->\n\nThere are two [[kidney]]s located dorsally, near the roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=849 }}\n\n=== Respiratory system ===\n[[File:Axolotl ganz.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Axolotl|The [[axolotl]] (\'\'Ambystoma mexicanum\'\') retains its larval form with gills into adulthood]]\nThe lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes, possessing few internal [[alveolar septum|septa]] and large [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood.

To enable sufficient [[cutaneous respiration]], the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }} Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the [[Telmatobius culeus|Titicaca water frog]] and the [[Cryptobranchus|hellbender salamander]]. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the [[Plethodontidae|plethodontid salamanders]], which have neither lungs nor gills.

They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforests]] and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the [[tadpole]] stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |author=Hogan, C.

In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=140–141 }}\n\nIn caecilians, fertilisation is internal, the male extruding an [[intromittent organ]], the {{visible anchor|phallodeum}}, and inserting it into the female cloaca. The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian [[prostate]] glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct.<ref name="Duellman">{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman |first=Willia E. |author2=Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=77–79 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&q=phallodeum&pg=PA77 |access-date=October 15, 2020 |archive-date=February 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203041327/https://books.google.com/books?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&q=phallodeum&pg=PA77 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe majority of salamanders also engage in [[internal fertilisation]]. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone, on the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called [[amplexus]]. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, [[Hynobiidae]] and [[Cryptobranchidae]] practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.<ref name="Duellman" />\n\nWith a few exceptions, frogs use external fertilisation. The male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs, or in the case of \'\'[[Epipedobates tricolor]]\'\', around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male\'s hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the [[granular poison frog]] (\'\'Oophaga granulifera\'\') where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The [[tailed frog]] (\'\'Ascaphus truei\'\') exhibits internal fertilisation. The "tail" is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154–162 }} The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the [[oviduct]] until the following spring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ascaphus&where-species=truei |title=\'\'Ascaphus truei\'\' |author1=Adams, Michael J. |author2=Pearl, Christopher A. |year=2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |access-date=November 23, 2012 |archive-date=November 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104012528/http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ascaphus&where-species=truei |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders. Typically, prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site, the males usually arriving first, calling and setting up territories. Other satellite males remain quietly nearby, waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory. The females arrive sporadically, mate selection takes place and eggs are laid. The females depart and territories may change hands. More females appear and in due course, the breeding season comes to an end. Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall. These frogs are typically [[wikt:fossorial|fossorial]] species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site. They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place, perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season. The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues, the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154–162 }}\n\n[[File:Plethodon cinereus.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|Sexual selection has been studied in the [[red back salamander]]]]\n<!--[[Sexual selection]] typically manifests as male-male competition where males will arrive at the waters edge first in large number, producing a wide range of vocalizations and other complex behaviours to attract mates, with the [[fitness (biology)|fittest]] males having the deepest croaks and the best territories.

In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by [[thyroxine]] concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and [[prolactin]], which counteracts thyroxine\'s effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last1 = Kikuyama\n | first1 = Sakae\n | last2 = Kawamura\n | first2 = Kousuke\n | last3 = Tanaka\n | first3 = Shigeyasu\n | last4 = Yamamoto\n | first4 = Kakutoshi\n | title = International Review of Cytology: A Survey of Cell Biology\n | chapter = Aspects of amphibian metamorphosis: Hormonal control\n | publisher = Academic Press\n | pages = 105–126\n | year = 1993\n | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wfSM70CuYqYC&q=amphibian+metamorphosis&pg=PA105\n | isbn = 978-0-12-364548-7\n | access-date = October 15, 2020\n | archive-date = April 14, 2021\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210414135624/https://books.google.com/books?id=wfSM70CuYqYC&q=amphibian+metamorphosis&pg=PA105\n | url-status = live\n }}</ref> Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances.

In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the [[alpine salamander]] (\'\'Salamandra atra\'\') and some of the [[Nectophrynoides|African live-bearing toads]] (\'\'Nectophrynoides spp.\'\') are [[Viviparity|viviparous]].

This is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure.

Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in [[lipid]]s and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as long as their mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth.

The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an [[Gular skin|air sac]] or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth.

Much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals. An aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively. If the intruder persisted, a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves. Damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival, either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.<ref name="Gergits" />\n\nIn frogs, male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a "home advantage" and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place. Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent\'s vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Wells, K.

Cholinesterase is an enzyme that causes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine, an excitatory neurotransmitter that is abundant in the nervous system.
