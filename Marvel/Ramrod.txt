The ramrod was used with weapons such as [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s and was usually held in a notch underneath the barrel.\n\nBullets that did not fit snugly in the barrel were often secured in place by a wad of paper or cloth, but either way, ramming was necessary to place the bullet securely at the rear of the barrel. Ramming was also needed to [[tamp]] the powder so that it would explode properly instead of fizzle (this was a leading cause of misfires).\n\nThe ramrod could also be fitted with tools for various tasks such as cleaning the weapon, or retrieving a stuck bullet.\n\n[[Caplock mechanism|Cap and ball]] [[revolver]]s were loaded a bit like muzzleloaders—powder was poured into each chamber of the [[cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]] from the muzzle end, and a bullet was then squeezed in. Such handguns usually had a ramming mechanism built into the frame. The user pulled a lever underneath the barrel of the pistol, which pushed a rammer into the aligned chamber. \n\n[[Naval artillery]] began as muzzle-loading cannon and these too required ramming. Large muzzle loading guns continued into the 1880s, using wooden staffs worked by several sailors as ramrods.<ref name="Hodges, 10" /> Manual ramming was replaced with hydraulic powered ramming with trials on {{HMS|Thunderer|1872|6}} from 1874.{{sfnp|Hodges|1981|page=19}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name="Hodges, 10" >{{Cite book\n  |title=The Big Gun: Battleship Main Armament 1860–1945\n  |last=Hodges  |first=Peter\n  |year=1981\n  |publisher=Conway Maritime Press\n  |isbn=0-85177-144-0\n  |page=10\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|ramrod}}\n\n[[Category:Firearm components]]\n\n\n{{Firearms-stub}}'}]}}
