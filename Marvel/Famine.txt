The frequency and intensity of famine has fluctuated throughout history, depending on changes in food demand, such as [[population growth]], and supply-side shifts caused by changing [[climate|climatic]] conditions. Famine was first eliminated in Holland and England during the 17th century, due to the [[commercialization]] of agriculture and the implementation of improved techniques to increase [[crop yield]]s.  {{citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\n===Decline of famine===\nIn the 16th and 17th century, the feudal system began to break down, and more prosperous farmers began to [[enclosure|enclose]] their own land and improve their yields to sell the surplus crops for a profit. These [[capitalism|capitalist]] landowners paid their labourers with [[wage labour|money]], thereby increasing the commercialization of rural society. In the emerging competitive labour market, better techniques for the improvement of labour productivity were increasingly valued and rewarded. It was in the farmer\'s interest to produce as much as possible on their land in order to sell it to areas that demanded that product. They produced guaranteed [[surplus value|surpluses]] of their crop every year if they could.\n\nSubsistence peasants were also increasingly forced to commercialize their activities because of increasing [[tax]]es. Taxes that had to be paid to central governments in money forced the peasants to produce crops to sell. Sometimes they produced [[industrial crop]]s, but they would find ways to increase their production in order to meet both their subsistence requirements as well as their tax obligations. Peasants also used the new money to purchase manufactured goods. The agricultural and social developments encouraging increased food production were gradually taking place throughout the 16th century, but took off in the early 17th century.\n\nBy the 1590s, these trends were sufficiently developed in the rich and commercialized province of [[Holland]] to allow its population to withstand a general outbreak of famine in Western Europe at that time. By that time, the [[Netherlands]] had one of the most commercialized agricultural systems in Europe. They grew many industrial crops such as [[flax]], [[hemp]] and [[hops]]. Agriculture became increasingly specialized and efficient. The efficiency of Dutch agriculture allowed for much more rapid urbanization in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries than anywhere else in Europe. As a result, productivity and wealth increased, allowing the Netherlands to maintain a steady food supply.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bieleman |first=Jan |url=http://www.neha.nl/publications/eshn-4/08-bieleman.pdf |title=Dutch Agriculture in the Golden Age, 1570–1660 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401022510/http://www.neha.nl/publications/eshn-4/08-bieleman.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy 1650, English agriculture had also become commercialized on a much wider scale. The last peacetime famine in England was in 1623–24. There were still periods of hunger, as in the Netherlands, but no more famines ever occurred. Common areas for pasture were [[enclosure|enclosed]] for private use and large scale, efficient farms were consolidated. Other technical developments included the draining of marshes, more efficient field use patterns, and the wider introduction of industrial crops. These agricultural developments led to wider prosperity in England and increasing urbanization.<ref>{{cite book |last=Curtler |first=W.H.R. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yomy8cKVOtkC |title=A Short History of English Agriculture |publisher=Etusevi Company |chapter=ch. 11|year=2005 |isbn=9781450515030 }}</ref> By the end of the 17th century, English agriculture was the most productive in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burns |first=William E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59ITUOLbVkoC |title=The Scientific Revolution: An Encyclopedia |year=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=7|isbn=978-0-87436-875-8 }}</ref> In both England and the Netherlands, the population stabilized between 1650 and 1750, the same time period in which the sweeping changes to agriculture occurred. Famine still occurred in other parts of Europe, however. In [[Eastern Europe]], famines occurred as late as the twentieth century.\n\n===Attempts at famine alleviation===\n[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Skibbereen]], Ireland during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], 1847 illustration by [[James Mahony]] for the \'\'[[Illustrated London News]]\'\']]\n\nBecause of the severity of famine, it was a chief concern for governments and other authorities. In pre-industrial Europe, preventing famine, and ensuring timely food supplies, was one of the chief concerns of many governments, although they were severely limited in their options due to limited levels of external trade, infrastructure, and bureaucracy generally too rudimentary to effect real relief. Most governments were concerned by famine because it could lead to [[revolt]] and other forms of social disruption.\n\nBy the mid-19th century and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], it became possible for governments to alleviate the effects of famine through [[price controls]], large scale importation of food products from foreign markets, stockpiling, [[rationing]], regulation of production and [[charity (practice)|charity]]. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of 1845]] in Ireland was one of the first famines to feature such intervention, although the government response was often lackluster. The initial response of the British government to the early phase of the famine was "prompt and relatively successful", according to [[F. S. L. Lyons]].<ref>{{citation |title=Ireland since the famine |first=Francis Stewart Leland |last=Lyons |publisher=Fontana |year=1973 |page=30}}</ref> Confronted by widespread crop failure in the autumn of 1845, Prime Minister [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] purchased £100,000 worth of maize and [[cornmeal]] secretly from America. [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers & Co]] initially acted as purchasing agents for the Prime Minister. The government hoped that they would not "stifle private enterprise" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.{{sfn|Kinealy|1995|p=38}} The maize corn was then re-sold for a penny a pound.<ref>{{citation |title=Disraeli |last=Blake |first=Robert |lccn=67011837 |series=University paperbacks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpRnAAAAMAAJ |year=1967 |publisher=St. Martin\'s Press |page=221}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, Peel moved to repeal the [[Corn Laws]], [[tariff]]s on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high. The famine situation worsened during 1846 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel\'s ministry.{{sfn|Blake|1967|pp=221–241}} In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland.<ref>{{citation |title=The Great Hunger |first=Cecil |last=Woodham-Smith |year=1962 |pages=78–86}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Famine in India Natives Waiting for Relief in Bangalore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|People waiting for famine relief in [[Bangalore]], India (from the \'\'[[Illustrated London News]]\'\', 1877)]]\n\nDespite this promising start, the measures undertaken by Peel\'s successor, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], proved comparatively "inadequate" as the crisis deepened. Russell\'s ministry introduced public works projects, which by December 1846 employed some half million Irish and proved impossible to administer. The government was influenced by a [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed. It halted government food and relief works, and turned to a mixture of "indoor" and "outdoor" direct relief; the former administered in [[workhouse]]s through the [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], the latter through [[soup kitchen]]s.<ref>{{citation |title=Ireland: History of a Nation |first=David |last=Ross |year=2002 |publisher=New Lanark: Geddes & Grosset |isbn=978-1-84205-164-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/irelandhistoryof0000ross/page/224 224, 311] |url=https://archive.org/details/irelandhistoryof0000ross/page/224 }}</ref>[[Image:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|\'\'[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (painting)|Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]\'\', an 1887 painting by Russian artist [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].

The famine code was also one of the first attempts to scientifically predict famine in order to mitigate its effects. These were finally passed into law in 1883 under [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]].\n\nThe [[Indian Famine Codes|Code]] introduced the first [[famine scale]]: three levels of [[food insecurity]] were defined: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine. "Scarcity" was defined as three successive years of [[crop failure]], [[crop yield]]s of one-third or one-half normal, and large populations in distress. "Famine" further included a rise in food prices above 140% of "normal", the movement of people in search of food, and widespread mortality.<ref name="L.

That said, many African countries are not self-sufficient in food production, relying on income from [[cash crop]]s to import food. [[Agriculture]] in Africa is susceptible to [[climate|climatic]] fluctuations, especially [[drought]]s which can reduce the amount of food produced locally. Other agricultural problems include [[Soil fertility|soil infertility]], [[land degradation]] and [[erosion]], swarms of [[desert locust]]s, which can destroy whole crops, and livestock diseases.

The 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia, for example, was the outcome of all these three factors, made worse by the Communist government\'s censorship of the emerging crisis. In Capitalist Sudan at the same date, drought and economic crisis combined with denials of any food shortage by the then-government of President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], to create a crisis that killed perhaps 250,000 people—and helped bring about a popular uprising that overthrew Nimeiry.\n\nNumerous factors make the [[food security]] situation in Africa tenuous, including political instability, armed conflict and [[civil war]], [[political corruption|corruption]] and mismanagement in handling food supplies, and trade policies that harm African agriculture. An example of a famine created by human rights abuses is the [[1998 Sudan famine]]. [[AIDS]] is also having long-term economic effects on agriculture by reducing the available workforce, and is creating new vulnerabilities to famine by overburdening poor households.

One pan-African example is the [[Great Green Wall (Africa)|Great Green Wall]]. Another example is the "Community Area-Based Development Approach" to agricultural development ("CABDA"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. Piloted in Ethiopia in the 1990s it has spread to Malawi, Uganda, Eritrea and Kenya. In an analysis of the programme by the [[Overseas Development Institute]], CABDA\'s focus on individual and community capacity-building is highlighted.

His regime emptied the cities, abolished currency and private property, and forced Cambodia\'s population into slavery on communal farms. In less than four years, the Khmer Rouge had executed nearly 1.4 million people, mostly those believed to be a threat to the new ideology.\n\nDue to the failure of the Khmer Rouge\'s agrarian reform policies, Cambodia experienced widespread famine.

For example, during the 1022–1033 Great famines in India entire provinces were depopulated. Famine in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] killed at least two million people in 1702–1704. B.M. Bhatia believes that the earlier famines were localised, and it was only after 1860, during the [[British Raj|British rule]], that famine came to signify general shortage of foodgrains in the country. There were approximately 25 major famines spread through states such as [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south, and [[Bihar]] and [[Bengal]] in the east during the latter half of the 19th century.\n\n[[File:India-famine-family-crop-420.jpg|thumb|Victims of the Great Famine of 1876–78 in India during British rule, pictured in 1877.]]\n[[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] argued as early as 1900, and present-day scholars such as [[Amartya Sen]] agree, that some historic famines were a product of both uneven rainfall and British economic and administrative policies, which since 1857 had led to the seizure and conversion of local farmland to foreign-owned plantations, restrictions on internal trade, heavy taxation of Indian citizens to support British expeditions in Afghanistan (see [[European influence in Afghanistan#Second Anglo-Afghan War|The Second Anglo-Afghan War]]), inflationary measures that increased the price of food, and substantial exports of staple crops from India to Britain. (Dutt, 1900 and 1902; Srivastava, 1968; Sen, 1982; Bhatia, 1985.)\n\nSome British citizens, such as [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], agitated for policy reforms and famine relief, but [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such changes in the belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. The first, the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], is estimated to have taken around 10 million lives—one-third of Bengal\'s population at the time. Other notable famines include the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]], in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died<ref name=mikedavis7>Davis, Mike. \'\'[[Late Victorian Holocausts]]\'\'. 1.

They observed that each province in [[British India]], including [[British Burma|Burma]], had a surplus of foodgrains, and the annual surplus was 5.16 million tons (Bhatia, 1970). At that time, annual export of rice and other grains from India was approximately one million tons.\n\n{{blockquote|Population growth worsened the plight of the peasantry. As a result of peace and improved sanitation and health, the Indian population rose from perhaps 100 million in 1700 to 300 million by 1920. While encouraging agricultural productivity, the British also provided economic incentives to have more children to help in the fields. Although a similar population increase occurred in Europe at the same time, the growing numbers could be absorbed by industrialization or emigration to the Americas and Australia. India enjoyed neither an industrial revolution nor an increase in food growing. Moreover, Indian landlords had a stake in the cash crop system and discouraged innovation. As a result, population numbers far outstripped the amount of available food and land, creating dire poverty and widespread hunger.|Craig A.

The prospect of starvation led people to take desperate measures. When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term survival. They would kill their [[draught animal]]s, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their seed corn, sacrificing next year\'s crop in the hope that more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They migrated to the cities where merchants from other areas would be more likely to sell their food, as cities had a stronger purchasing power than did rural areas. Cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order. With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, crime would often follow them. Many peasants resorted to banditry in order to acquire enough to eat.\n\nOne famine would often lead to difficulties in the following years because of lack of seed stock or disruption of routine, or perhaps because of less-available labour. Famines were often interpreted as signs of God\'s displeasure. They were seen as the removal, by God, of His gifts to the people of the Earth. Elaborate religious processions and rituals were made to prevent God\'s wrath in the form of famine.\n\n====16th century====\n[[File:Goya-Guerra (59).jpg|thumb|An engraving from [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]\'s \'\'[[Disasters of War]]\'\', showing starving women, doubtless inspired by the terrible famine that struck [[Madrid]] in 1811–1812.]]\nDuring the 15th century to the 18th century, famines in Europe became more frequent due to the [[Little Ice Age]]. The colder climate resulted in harvest failures and shortfalls that led to a rise in [[conspiracy theories]] concerning the causes behind these famines, such as the [[Pacte de Famine]] in France.<ref>Kaplan, Steven. \'\'The Famine Plot Persuasion in Eighteenth-Century France\'\'. Pennsylvania: Diane Publishing Co, 1982. {{ISBN|0-87169-723-8}}</ref>\n\nThe 1590s saw the worst famines in centuries across all of Europe. Famine had been relatively rare during the 16th century. The economy and population had grown steadily as subsistence populations tend to when there is an extended period of relative peace (most of the time). Although peasants in areas of high population density, such as northern Italy, had learned to increase the yields of their lands through techniques such as promiscuous culture, they were still quite vulnerable to famines, forcing them to work their land even more intensively.\n\nThe great famine of the 1590s began a period of famine and decline in the 17th century. The price of grain, all over Europe was high, as was the population. Various types of people were vulnerable to the succession of bad harvests that occurred throughout the 1590s in different regions. The increasing number of wage labourers in the countryside were vulnerable because they had no food of their own, and their meager living was not enough to purchase the expensive grain of a bad-crop year. Town labourers were also at risk because their wages would be insufficient to cover the cost of grain, and, to make matters worse, they often received less money in bad-crop years since the disposable income of the wealthy was spent on grain. Often, unemployment would be the result of the increase in grain prices, leading to ever-increasing numbers of urban poor.\n\nAll areas of Europe were badly affected by the famine in these periods, especially rural areas. The Netherlands was able to escape most of the damaging effects of the famine, though the 1590s were still difficult years there. [[Amsterdam]]\'s [[grain trade]] with the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] guaranteed a food supply.\n\n====17th century====\nThe years around 1620 saw another period of famine sweep across Europe. These famines were generally less severe than the famines of twenty-five years earlier, but they were nonetheless quite serious in many areas. Perhaps the worst famine since 1600, the great famine in [[Finland]] in 1696, killed one-third of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf |title= Home|website=www.euro.who.int |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009053403/http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nDevastating harvest failures afflicted the northern Italian economy from 1618 to 1621, and it did not recover fully for centuries.

Climate Change 83:495–514.</ref> To do this, he draws on a range of historic cases where relatively small environmental problems triggered famines as a way of creating theoretical links between climate and famine in the future.

The first line of defense is the [[Agroecosystem|agro-ecosystem]] on which food is produced: diverse ecosystems with well managed soils high in [[organic matter]] tend to be more resilient. The second line of defense is the wealth and skills of individual households: If those households affected by bad weather such as drought have savings or skills they may be able to do all right despite the bad weather.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Papaioannou|first=Kostadis |title=Weather shocks and agricultural commercialization in colonial tropical Africa: did cash crops alleviate social distress? |journal=World Development |volume=94 |issue=3 |date=June 2017 |pages=346–365 |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.01.019 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/74029/1/Papaioannou_Weather%20shocks%20and%20agricultural_2017.pdf }}</ref> The final line of defense is created by the formal institutions present in a society. Governments, churches, or NGOs must be willing and able to mount effective relief efforts. Pulling this together, Evan Fraser argues that if an [[ecosystem]] is resilient enough, it may be able to withstand weather-related shocks. But if these shocks overwhelm the ecosystem\'s line of defense, it is necessary for the household to adapt using its skills and savings. If a problem is too big for the family or household, then people must rely on the third line of defense, which is whether or not the formal institutions present in a society are able to provide help. Evan Fraser concludes that in almost every situation where an environmental problem triggered a famine you see a failure in each of these three lines of defense.<ref name="Fraser2006">{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Evan D.G. |title=Food system vulnerability: Using past famines to help understand how food systems may adapt to climate change |journal=Ecological Complexity |date=December 2006 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=328–335 |doi=10.1016/j.ecocom.2007.02.006 }}</ref> Hence, understanding how climate change may cause famines in the future requires combining both an assessment of local socio-economic and environmental factors along with [[climate models]] that predict where bad weather may occur in the future.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simelton |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Fraser |first2=Evan D.G. |last3=Termansen |first3=Mette |last4=Forster |first4=Piers M. |last5=Dougill |first5=Andrew J. |title=Typologies of crop-drought vulnerability: an empirical analysis of the socio-economic factors that influence the sensitivity and resilience to drought of three major food crops in China (1961–2001) |journal=Environmental Science & Policy |date=June 2009 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=438–452 |doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2008.11.005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simelton |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Fraser |first2=Evan D.

Some definitions of famines are:\n* Blix&nbsp;– Widespread food shortage leading to significant rise in regional death rates.{{sfn|Blix|Svensk näringsforskning|1971|p=}}\n* Brown and Eckholm&nbsp;– Sudden, sharp reduction in food supply resulting in widespread hunger.{{sfn|Brown|Eckholm|1974|p=}}\n* Scrimshaw&nbsp;– Sudden collapse in level of food consumption of large numbers of people.{{sfn|Scrimshaw|1987|p=}}\n* Ravallion&nbsp;– Unusually high mortality with unusually severe threat to food intake of some segments of a population.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=2}}\n* Cuny&nbsp;– A set of conditions that occurs when large numbers of people in a region cannot obtain sufficient food, resulting in widespread, acute malnutrition.{{sfn|Cuny|1999|p=}}\n\nFood shortages in a population are caused either by a lack of food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010|p=}} However, FAD could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} Based on the studies of some recent famines, the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and it has been suggested that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability. According to this view, famines are a result of entitlements, the theory being proposed is called the "failure of exchange entitlements" or FEE.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was eliminated.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}}\n\nAccording to the Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), global [[climate change]] is additionally challenging the Earth\'s ability to produce food, potentially leading to famine.<ref name="Psrccaf">{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Famine|url=http://www.psr.org/resources/climate-change-and-famine.html|publisher=Physicians for Social Responsibility|access-date=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome elements make a particular region more vulnerable to famine.

Famine is often associated with [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] agriculture. The total absence of agriculture in an economically strong area does not cause famine; Arizona and other wealthy regions import the vast majority of their food, since such regions produce sufficient economic goods for trade.\n\nFamines have also been caused by volcanism. The 1815 eruption of the [[Mount Tambora]] volcano in Indonesia caused crop failures and famines worldwide and caused the worst famine of the 19th century. The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun\'s energy from reaching the ground. The same mechanism is theorized to be caused by very large meteorite impacts to the extent of causing mass extinctions.\n\n===State-sponsored famines===\nIn certain cases, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] in China (which produced the [[Great Chinese Famine|largest famine in absolute numbers]]), [[North Korean famine|North Korea in the mid-1990s]], or [[Zimbabwe]] in the early-2000s, famine can occur because of government policy.\n\n[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|The government\'s [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]] of agriculture was one of the main causes of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].]]\nAccording to [[Simon Payaslian]], a tentative scholarly consensus classifies the Soviet famine (at least in Ukraine where 2.5 to 4 million perished<ref>{{cite journal|page=28| title=Towards a Decentred History: The Study of the Holodomor and Ukrainian Historiography |first=Olga |last=Andriewsky|doi=10.21226/T2301N| volume=2|issue=1|journal=East/West: Journal of Ukrainian Studies |url=https://ewjus.com/index.php/ewjus/article/download/Andriewsky/24| year=2015|doi-access=free}}</ref>) as a [[genocide]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Payaslian|first=Simon|title=International Relations|date=11 January 2021|chapter-url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199743292/obo-9780199743292-0105.xml|chapter=20th Century Genocides|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199743292-0105|isbn=978-0-19-974329-2|access-date=26 November 2021|via=Oxford Bibliographies Online}}</ref> although some scholars say that it remains a significant issue in modern politics and dispute whether Soviet policies would fall under the [[legal definition of genocide]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Marples|first=David R.|date=30 November 2005|url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=7176|url-status=dead|title=The great famine debate goes on...|work=Edmont Journal|publisher=University of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615015541/http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=7176|archive-date=15 June 2008|access-date=28 November 2021|via=ExpressNews}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kulchytsky|first=Stanislav|date=17 February 2007|url=https://day.kyiv.ua/uk/article/podrobici/golodomor-1932-1933-rr-yak-genocid-progalini-u-dokazoviy-bazi-1 |title=Holodomor 1932–1933 rr. yak henotsyd: prohalyny u dokazovii bazi|script-title=uk:Голодомор 1932 — 1933 рр. як геноцид: прогалини у доказовій базі|trans-title=Holodomor 1932–1933 as genocide: gaps in the evidence|work=Den|language=uk|access-date=19 January 2021}}</ref>  Several scholars have disputed that the famine was a genocidal act by the Soviet government, including [[J.

Humanitarian crises may also arise from [[genocide]] campaigns, [[civil war]]s, [[agro-terrorism]], [[refugee]] flows and episodes of extreme violence and state collapse, creating famine conditions among the affected populations.\n\nDespite repeated stated intentions by the world\'s leaders to end hunger and famine, famine remains a chronic threat in much of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Southeast, South Asia, and the Middle East. In July 2005, the [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]] (FEWS NET) labelled Niger with emergency status, as well as Chad, Ethiopia, [[South Sudan]], Somalia and Zimbabwe. In January 2006, the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] warned that 11 million people in Somalia, [[Kenya]], [[Djibouti]] and Ethiopia were in danger of starvation due to the combination of severe drought and military conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000206/index.html|title=Millions of people are on the brink of starvation in the Horn of Africa|website=Fao.org|access-date=1 February 2016}}</ref> In 2006, the most serious humanitarian crisis in Africa was in [[Sudan]]\'s region [[Darfur]].\n\n[[Frances Moore Lappé]], later co-founder of the [[Institute for Food and Development Policy]] (Food First) argued in \'\'[[Diet for a Small Planet]]\'\' (1971) that vegetarian diets can provide food for larger populations, with the same resources, compared to omnivorous diets.\n\nNoting that modern famines are sometimes aggravated by misguided economic policies, political design to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, or acts of war, political economists have investigated the political conditions under which famine is prevented. Economist [[Amartya Sen]]{{refn|Sen is known for his assertion that famines do not occur in democracies in much the same way that [[Adam Smith]] is associated with the "[[invisible hand]]" and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] with "[[creative destruction]]".{{sfn|Massing|2003|p=1}}|group=note}} states that the liberal institutions that exist in India, including competitive elections and a free press, have played a major role in preventing famine in that country since independence. [[Alex de Waal]] has developed this theory to focus on the "political contract" between rulers and people that ensures famine prevention, noting the rarity of such political contracts in Africa, and the danger that international relief agencies will undermine such contracts through removing the locus of accountability for famines from national governments.\n\nThe demographic impacts of famine are sharp. Mortality is concentrated among children and the elderly. A consistent demographic fact is that in all recorded famines, male mortality exceeds female, even in those populations (such as northern India and Pakistan) where there is a male longevity advantage during normal times. Reasons for this may include greater female resilience under the pressure of malnutrition, and possibly female\'s naturally higher percentage of body fat. Famine is also accompanied by lower fertility. Famines therefore leave the reproductive core of a population—adult women—lesser affected compared to other population categories, and post-famine periods are often characterized a "rebound" with increased births.\n\nEven though the theories of [[Thomas Malthus]] would predict that famines reduce the size of the population commensurate with available food resources, in fact even the most severe famines have rarely dented population growth for more than a few years. The mortality in China in 1958–61, Bengal in 1943, and Ethiopia in 1983–85 was all made up by a growing population over just a few years. Of greater long-term demographic impact is emigration: Ireland was chiefly depopulated after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|1840s famines]] by waves of emigration.\n\n===Overall food production===\n[[File:Food production per capita.svg|thumb|right]]\nGlobally, the amount of food produced per person has kept rising, despite a growing world population. A local crop failure does not cause a famine unless there is also a lack of money to buy food from elsewhere.

Various methods of categorizing the gradations of food security have thus been used in order to most efficiently allocate food relief. One of the earliest were the [[Indian Famine Codes]] devised by the British in the 1880s. The Codes listed three stages of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity and famine, and were highly influential in the creation of subsequent famine warning or measurement systems. The early warning system developed to monitor the region inhabited by the [[Turkana people]] in northern Kenya also has three levels, but links each stage to a pre-planned response to mitigate the crisis and prevent its deterioration\n\nThe experiences of famine relief organizations throughout the world over the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major developments: the "livelihoods approach" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement income, etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of [[agriculture|agricultural]] land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass [[starvation]]. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving [[Market (economics)|markets]], the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine\'s severity.\n\nSince 2003, many of the most important organizations in famine relief, such as the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], have adopted a five-level scale measuring intensity and magnitude. The intensity scale uses both livelihoods\' measures and measurements of mortality and child malnutrition to categorize a situation as food secure, food insecure, food crisis, famine, severe famine, and extreme famine. The number of deaths determines the magnitude designation, with under 1000 fatalities defining a "minor famine" and a "catastrophic famine" resulting in over 1,000,000 deaths.\n\n==Society and culture==\nFamine personified as an [[allegory]] is found in some cultures, e.g. one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in Christian tradition, the [[fear gorta]] of Irish folklore, or the [[Wendigo]] of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tradition.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[2007–2008 world food price crisis]]\n* [[Peak oil#Agricultural effects and population limits|Agriculture and population limits]]\n* [[Atmit]] (a porridge used to fight famine)\n* \n* [[Democide]]\n* [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]]\n* [[Food prices]]\n* [[Food security]]\n* [[Global Hunger Index]]\n* [[List of famines]]\n* [[Local food]]\n* [[Malthusianism]]\n* [[Nuclear winter]]\n* [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]]\n* [[Global catastrophic risk]]\n* [[Right of asylum#Right of asylum by country of refuge|Right of asylum: protected grounds]]\n* [[Starvation]]\n* [[Subsistence crisis]]\n* \'\'[[The vulture and the little girl]]\'\': photo by [[Kevin Carter]] of a vulture lurking a famine-stricken [[Sudan]]ese toddler.\n* [[World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates]] (monthly report)\n* [[World Food Programme]]\n* [[World Vision Famine events]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name="IPC_famine">{{cite web | title= IPC and Famine | website= [[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification]] |year=2013 | url = http://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/resources/resources-details/en/c/1129202 | access-date = 11 February 2021 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20210211002558/http://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/resources/resources-details/en/c/1129202 |archive-date= 11 February 2021 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n* Arnold, David. \'\'Famine: Social Crisis and Historical Change\'\' (Basil Blackwell, 1988).\n* Ashton, Basil, et al.
