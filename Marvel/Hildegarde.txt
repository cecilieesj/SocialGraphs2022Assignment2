She was known for 70 years as \'\'\'The Incomparable Hildegarde\'\'\', a title bestowed on her by columnist [[Walter Winchell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/001647.asp |title=Museum Object of the Week: The "Incomparable" Hildegarde Record |website=Wisconsin Historical Society |access-date=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217042722/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/001647.asp |archive-date=February 17, 2007}}</ref> She was also nicknamed the "First Lady of the Supper Clubs" by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=WashingtonPostAugust12005 />\n\nShe was once referred to as a "luscious, hazel-eyed Milwaukee blonde who sings the way Garbo looks".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760941,00.html |title=Radio: Art & Tires |date=March 13, 1939 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref> During the peak of her popularity in the 1930s and 1940s, she was booked in cabarets and [[supper club]]s at least 45 weeks a year. Her recordings sold in the hundreds of thousands, and her admirers ranged from soldiers during World War II to [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|King Gustaf VI Adolph]] of [[Sweden]] and the [[Duke of Windsor]]. On some of her recordings, she was accompanied by band leader [[Carroll Gibbons]]. During most of the 1940s she appeared on the "Raleigh Room", an [[NBC Radio]] program.<ref name=WashingtonPostAugust12005 />\n\nShe wore elegant gowns and [[long gloves]]. "[[Miss Piggy]] stole the gloves idea from me," she once said. A noted flirt, she told risqu√© anecdotes while giving long-stemmed roses to men in her audience. During one performance she waltzed with a U.S. Senator. She is credited with starting a single-name vogue among entertainers.  Investments and work in ads for a bottled-water company, barley vitamins and a bathtub device gave her a comfortable income through the rock era.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20050801&slug=hildegardeobit01 |title=Cabaret singer Hildegarde is dead at 99 |date=August 1, 2005 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |access-date=January 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==As an inspiration==\nShe appeared on the cover of \'\'[[Life (magazine)|Life]]\'\' in 1939, and [[Revlon]] introduced a Hildegarde shade of [[lipstick]] and [[nail polish]]. She was an inspiration for [[Liberace]], who once acknowledged her influence on his performances: \n"Hildegarde was perhaps the most famous supper-club entertainer who ever lived. I used to absorb all the things she was doing, all the showmanship she created. It was marvelous to watch her, wearing elegant gowns, surrounded with roses and playing with white gloves on. They used to literally roll out the red carpet for her".\n\n==Television and stage==\nFrom the 1950s through the 1970s, in addition to her cabaret performances and [[record album]]s, she appeared in a number of [[television]] specials and toured with the national company of the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical \'\'[[Follies]]\'\'.\n\nShe appeared as the celebrity mystery guest on \'\'[[What\'s My Line?]]\'\' on May 8, 1955.

It was always \'hello and goodbye\'". She was the business partner and good friend of [[Anna Sosenko]], an aspiring songwriter whom she met at a boarding house in Camden, New Jersey at the beginning of her career.<ref name=WashingtonPostAugust12005/> That relationship ended in litigation over the control of receipts from their joint efforts.
