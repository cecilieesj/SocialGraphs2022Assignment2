Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many [[bilateria|bilaterally symmetric forms]] do, regardless of size. \n\nHeads develop in animals by an [[evolution]]ary trend known as [[cephalization]]. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, [[nervous tissue]]s concentrate at the [[anterior]] region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head.\n[[File:Beethovendeathmask.jpg|thumb|The head of a [[death mask]]]]\n\n== Human head ==\n{{main article|Human head|Head and neck anatomy}}\nThe [[human head]] is an anatomical unit that consists of the [[Human skull|skull]], [[hyoid bone]] and [[cervical vertebrae]].

As these components differ substantially from insect to insect, they form important identification links. Eyes in the head found, in several types of insects, are in the form of a pair of compound eyes with multiple faces. In many other types of insects the compound eyes are seen in a "single facet or group of single facets". In some cases, the eyes may be seen as marks on the [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] or located near or toward the head,  two or three [[ocelli]] (single faceted organs).<ref name="McCafferty1983">{{cite book|first=W.

[[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|Labrum]] is the "upper lip" which is in the front area of the head and is the most exterior part.  A pair of mandible is found on backside of the labrum flanking the side of the mouth, succeeded by a pair of [[Maxilla (arthropod mouthpart)|maxillae]] each of which is known as [[maxilliary palp]]. At the back side of the mouth is the [[labium (arthropod mouthpart)|labium]] or lower lip.

In some cases, segments or a portion of the segments disappear. The head segments also lose most of its systems except for the nervous system. With the progressive development of [[cephalization]], "the head incorporates more and more of the adjacent segments into its structure, so that in general it may be said that the higher the degree of cephalization the greater is the number of segments composing the head".<ref name="Hyman1992">{{cite book|first=Libbie Henrietta|last=Hyman|title=Hyman\'s Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC&pg=PA4|date=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87013-7 |edition=3rd |pages=4.

Female head, in particular, is sketched in a double circle design procedure with proportions considered as an ideal of a female head. In the first circle, the division is made of five sections on the [[diameter]], each section of five eyes width. It is then developed over a series of ten defined steps with the smaller circle imposed partially over the larger circle at the lower end at the fourth stage. Eyes and chins are fitted in various shapes to form the head.<ref>{{cite book|title=Drawing the Head and Figure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qI91-vhOm8wC|date=January 1983|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-399-50791-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one of the world\'s greatest artists who drew sketches of human anatomy using grid structures.
