It is a silvery-grey [[metal]] in the [[actinide]] series of the [[periodic table]]. A uranium atom has 92 [[proton]]s and 92 [[electron]]s, of which 6 are [[valence electron]]s. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] because all [[isotopes of uranium]] are unstable; the [[half-lives]] of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5&nbsp;billion years. The most common isotopes in [[natural uranium]] are [[uranium-238]] (which has 146 [[neutron]]s and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and [[uranium-235]] (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest [[atomic weight]] of the [[primordial nuclide|primordially]] occurring elements. Its [[density]] is about 70% higher than that of [[lead]], and slightly lower than that of [[gold]] or [[tungsten]]. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|parts per million]] in soil, rock and water, and is commercially [[uranium mining|extracted]] from uranium-bearing [[mineral]]s such as [[uraninite]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranium|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/uranium|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198–0.7202%), and a very small amount of [[uranium-234]] (0.0050–0.0059%).<ref>{{cite Q|Q91488549}}</ref> Uranium decays slowly by emitting an [[alpha particle]]. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years and that of uranium-235 is 704 [[million]] years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ie.lbl.gov/toi/nucSearch.asp|title=WWW Table of Radioactive Isotopes|work=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, US|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427084707/http://ie.lbl.gov/toi/nucSearch.asp|archive-date=27 April 2007}}</ref> making them useful in dating the [[age of the Earth]].\n\nMany contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] properties. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring [[fissile]] [[isotope]], which makes it widely used in [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is [[fertile material|fertile]], meaning it can be [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] to fissile [[plutonium-239]] in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Another fissile isotope, [[uranium-233]], can be produced from natural [[thorium]] and is studied for future industrial use in nuclear technology.{{fact|date=April 2022}} Uranium-238 has a small probability for [[spontaneous fission]] or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. [[Depleted uranium]] (<sup>238</sup>U) is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s and [[vehicle armour|armor plating]].<ref name="BuildingBlocks479">{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=479}}.</ref> Uranium is used as a colorant in [[uranium glass]], producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early [[photography]].\n\nThe 1789 [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of uranium in the mineral [[uraninite|pitchblende]] is credited to [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], who named the new element after the recently discovered planet [[Uranus]]. [[Eugène-Melchior Péligot]] was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]]. Research by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, such as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the [[nuclear power]] industry and in \'\'[[Little Boy]]\'\', the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first nuclear weapon used in war]]. An ensuing [[arms race]] during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived [[plutonium-239]]. The security of those weapons is closely monitored. Since around 2000, plutonium obtained by dismantling Cold War-era bombs is used as fuel for nuclear reactors. The development and deployment of these [[nuclear reactor]]s continue on a global base as they are powerful sources of CO<sub>2</sub>-free energy.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A neutron-induced nuclear fission event involving uranium-235|alt=A diagram showing a chain transformation of uranium-235 to uranium-236 to barium-141 and krypton-92]]\nWhen [[refining (metallurgy)|refined]], uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive [[metal]].

Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 [[isotope]] will most of the time divide into two smaller [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], releasing nuclear [[binding energy]] and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a [[nuclear chain reaction]] occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a [[neutron poison]], absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor [[control rod]]s (see [[nuclear reactor physics]] for a description of this process of reactor control).\n\nAs little as {{cvt|15|lb}} of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb.<ref name="EncyIntel">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security|publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|title=uranium|url=http://www.answers.com/uranium}}</ref> The nuclear weapon detonated over [[Hiroshima]], called \'\'[[Little Boy]]\'\', relied on uranium fission.

The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see [[Gulf War syndrome]]).<ref name="EncyIntel" />\n\nDepleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than [[lead]] in halting radiation from strong sources such as [[radium]].<ref name="SciTechEncy" /> Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile [[atmospheric reentry|re-entry vehicles]] and as a shielding material.<ref name="LANL" /> Due to its high density, this material is found in [[inertial guidance system]]s and in [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] [[compass]]es.<ref name="LANL" /> Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost.<ref name="BuildingBlocks480">{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=480}}.</ref> The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by [[uranium oxide]] rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak [[alpha decay|alpha emitter]]).\n\nDuring the later stages of [[World War II]], the entire [[Cold War]], and to a lesser extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses [[plutonium-239]] derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ([[thermonuclear weapon]]) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of [[tritium]] and [[deuterium]] to undergo [[nuclear fusion]]. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by [[fast neutron]]s from the nuclear fusion process.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm\n |title=Nuclear Weapon Design\n |publisher=Federation of American Scientists\n |date=1998\n |access-date=19 February 2007\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226091803/https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm\n |archive-date=26 December 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n===Civilian===\n[[File:Nuclear Power Plant 2.jpg|thumb|The most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in [[nuclear power plant]]s.|alt=Photograph featuring sunflowers in front and a plant on the back.
