Imperii Orientalis et Circumjacentium Regionum.1742.jpg|thumb|\'\'Imperii Orientalis et Circumjacentium Regionum\'\' by [[Guillaume Delisle]] (1742)]]\nAn \'\'\'atlas\'\'\' is a collection of [[map]]s; it is typically a bundle of [[maps of Earth]] or of a region of [[Earth]].\n\nAtlases have traditionally been bound into book form, but today many atlases are in [[multimedia]] formats.  In addition to presenting [[geographic]] features and [[political]] boundaries, many atlases often feature [[geopolitical]], social, [[religious]] and [[economic]] [[statistics]]. They also have information about the map and places in it.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe use of the word "atlas" in a geographical context dates from 1595 when the German-Flemish geographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] published {{lang|la|Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura}} ("Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe and the universe as created"). This title provides Mercator\'s definition of the word as a description of the creation and form of the whole universe, not simply as a collection of maps. The volume that was published posthumously one year after his death is a wide-ranging text but, as the editions evolved, it became simply a collection of maps and it is in that sense that the word was used from the middle of the 17th century. The neologism coined by Mercator was a mark of his respect for the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], the "King of Mauretania", whom he considered to be the first great geographer.<ref>Mercator\'s own account of the reasons for choosing King Atlas are given in the preface of the 1595 atlas. A translation by David Sullivan is available in a digital version of the atlas published by  [https://web.archive.org/web/20050314051106/http://www.octavo.com/editions/mcrats/ Octavo].

Rather, that title is awarded to the collection of maps \'\'[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]\'\' by the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] printed in 1570.\n\nHowever atlases published nowadays are quite different from those published in the 16th–19th centuries. Unlike today, most atlases were not bound and ready for the customer to buy, but their possible components were shelved separately. The client could select the contents to their liking, and have the maps coloured/gilded or not. The atlas was then bound. Thus early printed atlases with the same title page can be different in contents.<ref>Jan Smits, Todd Fell (2011). Early printed atlases: shaping Plato\'s \'Forms\' into bibliographic descriptions. In: \'\'Journal of map & geography libraries : advances in geospatial information, collections & archives\'\', (ISSN 1542-0353), 7(2011)2, p. 184-210.</ref>\n\n==Types of atlases==\nA \'\'travel atlas\'\' is made for easy use during travel, and often has spiral bindings so it may be folded flat (for example [[Geographers\' A-Z Map Company]] famous A–Z atlases). It has maps at a large zoom so the maps can be reviewed easily.{{clarify|date=November 2021}} A travel atlas may also be referred to as a \'\'road map\'\'.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/road%20map|title=Road map|dictionary= Merriam Webster|access-date=2012-05-31}}</ref>\n\nA \'\'desk atlas\'\' is made similar to a reference book.
