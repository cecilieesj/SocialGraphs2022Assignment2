Their style has been described as modern [[death metal]] with [[black metal|black]] and [[industrial metal|industrial]] undertones. After more than a two-year hiatus, the band officially split up in January 2010.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=133019 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - ZYKLON Calls It Quits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111035550/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=133019 |date=11 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAll the band\'s lyrics were written by former Emperor drummer [[Faust (musician)|Faust]], then member of [[Amen (American band)|Casey Chaos]]\' side project [[Scum (band)|Scum]] and Italian [[industrial music|industrial]] [[black metal]] band [[Aborym]].\n\nDespite Samoth having been in a previous Emperor side project called [[Zyklon-B (band)|Zyklon-B]], the two are not related; [[Zyklon B]] is the name of a [[Zyklon B|lethal gas]] used by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during [[the Holocaust]]; "Zyklon" is, according to Samoth, a play on the word "[[cyclone]]", since the word is spelled \'\'syklon\'\' in Norwegian.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2020}}\nZyklon\'s debut album, \'\'[[World ov Worms]]\'\' (2001), showcased fast [[Riff|riffing]] and [[blastbeat|blast beats]]. However, after this release, Zyklon\'s line-up changed drastically, and the official line-up became Samoth, Trym Torson, Destructhor, and Secthdamon.\n\nThe band\'s second album, \'\'[[Aeon (album)|Aeon]]\'\' (2003), exposed the band to media attention, and videos were made for two tracks, "Core Solution" and "Psyklon Aeon".\n\nThe band\'s third effort was recorded from November to December 2005 at the Akkerhaugen Lydstudio in Norway; \'\'[[Disintegrate (Zyklon album)|Disintegrate]]\'\' was released in May 2006. In October 2007, the band went on hiatus, before splitting up 15 months later.\n\n==Members==\n\n===Last line-up===\n*[[Secthdamon]] – vocals, bass <small>(2001–2010)</small>\n*[[Samoth]] – guitar <small>(2000–2010)</small>\n*[[Destructhor]] – guitar <small>(2000–2010)</small>\n*[[Trym Torson|Trym]] – drums <small>(2000–2010)</small>\n\n===Former members===\n*Daemon – vocals <small>(2000&ndash;2001)</small>\n*Cosmocrator – bass <small>(2000&ndash;2001)</small>\n\n==Discography==\n*\'\'[[World ov Worms]]\'\' (2001)\n*\'\'[[Aeon (album)|Aeon]]\'\' (2003)\n*Split with [[Red Harvest (band)|Red Harvest]] (CD, 2003)\n*\'\'[[Disintegrate (Zyklon album)|Disintegrate]]\'\' (2006)\n*\'\'The Storm Manifesto\'\' (compilation of all previous recorded works) (CD, 2010)\n\n===DVDs===\n*\'\'Storm Detonation Live\'\' (2006)\n\n=== Music videos ===\n* "Psyklon Aeon"\n* "Core Solution"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{allmusic}}\n*[http://www.nocturnalart.com/ Nocturnal Art Samoth\'s record label]\n*[http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/band.php?band_id=284&bandname=Zyklon Zyklon at Metal Storm]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070823205159/http://www.webbworks.org/thelodge/zykloninterview.htm Zyklon interview with Samoth for The Lodge]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070807232621/http://www.webbworks.org/thelodge/tryminterview.htm Exclusive interview with Trym for The Lodge]\n\n{{Zyklon}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Norwegian blackened death metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1998]]\n[[Category:1998 establishments in Norway]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2010]]\n[[Category:2010 disestablishments in Norway]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Norway with local place of origin missing]] <!-- hidden maintenance category -->'}]}}
