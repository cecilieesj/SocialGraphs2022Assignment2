Hellhounds occur in mythologies around the world, with the best known examples being [[Cerberus]] from [[Greek mythology]], [[Garmr]] from [[Norse mythology]], the [[Black dog (folklore)|black dogs]] of [[English folklore]], and the fairy hounds of [[Celtic mythology]].

They were associated with a form of the [[Wild Hunt]], presided over by [[Gwynn ap Nudd]] (rather than [[Arawn]], king of Annwn in the [[Mabinogi|First Branch of the Mabinogi]]). [[Christians]] came to dub these mythical creatures as "The Hounds of Hell" or "Dogs of Hell" and theorized they were therefore owned by Satan.<ref>{{cite book |last = Pugh |first = Jane |title = Welsh Ghostly Encounters |publisher = Gwasg Carreg Gwalch |year = 1990|isbn = 0-86381-791-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title = Celtic Mythology |publisher = Geddes and Grosset |year = 1999|isbn = 1-85534-299-5}}</ref> However, the Annwn of medieval Welsh tradition is an otherworldly paradise and not a hell or abode of dead souls.\n\nIn [[Wales]], they were associated with [[Bird migration|migrating]] [[goose|geese]], supposedly because their honking in the night is reminiscent of barking dogs. They are supposed to hunt on specific nights (the eves of [[John the Apostle|St. John]], [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin]], Saint [[Michael the Archangel]], [[All Saints\' Day|All Saints]], [[Christmas]], [[New Year]], [[Saint Agnes]], [[Saint David]], and [[Good Friday]]), or just in the autumn and winter. Some say Arawn only hunts from Christmas to [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The Cŵn Annwn also came to be regarded as the escorts of souls on their journey to the [[Otherworld]]. The hounds are sometimes accompanied by a fearsome hag called [[Mallt-y-Nos]], "Matilda of the Night". An alternative name in Welsh folklore is Cŵn Mamau ("Hounds of the Mothers").\n\n===The Americas===\n\n====Latin America====\nBlack hellhounds with fiery eyes are reported throughout [[Latin America]] from [[Mexico]] to [[Argentina]] under a variety of names including the Perro Negro (Spanish for black dog), [[Nahual]] (Mexico), [[Huaychivo|Huay Chivo]], and Huay Pek (Mexico) – alternatively spelled Uay/Way/Waay Chivo/Pek, [[Cadejo]] (Central America), the [[Familiar spirit|dog Familiar]] (Argentina) and the [[Luison|Lobizon]] (Paraguay and Argentina).

The dog is said to haunt the [[Hanging Hills]]: a series of rock ridges and gorges that serve as a popular recreation area and can also be known as a protector of the supernatural. The first non-local account came from W. H. C. Pychon in \'\'The Connecticut Quarterly\'\', in which it is described as a death omen.

The negative depiction of dogs probably derives from their close association with "eating the dead" (relishing bones) and digging out graves. The jinn likewise is often said to roam around graveyards and eating corpses. These characteristics relates them to each other.<ref>Amira El Zein: The Evolution of the Concept of Jinn from Pre-Islam to Islam\'. p. 264</ref>\n\n====India====\nThe \'\'Mahākanha Jātaka\'\' of the [[Buddhist]] [[Pali Canon]] includes a story about a black hound named \'\'Mahākanha\'\' ([[Pali]]; lit. "Great black"). Led by the god [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] in the guise of a forester, Mahākanha scares unrighteous people toward righteousness so that fewer people will be reborn in hell. \n\nHis appearance portends the moral degeneration of the human world, when [[bhikkhu|monks]] and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]] do not behave as they should and humanity has gone astray from ethical livelihood.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rouse |first1=W.

It has the ability to breathe fire. However, the Fourth Edition depicts them as nearly skeletal canines wreathed in flame. The hell hound enjoys causing pain and suffering and it hunts accordingly. A favorite pack tactic is to silently surround prey, and then cause two hell hounds to close in and make the victim back into another hell hound\'s fiery breath. They will attack with their claws and teeth if they have to. If the prey manages to escape, the hell hounds will pursue it relentlessly. Hell hounds are also quick and agile. Another type of hell hound is the Nessian warhound. Nessian warhounds are coal black mastiffs the size of [[draft horse]]s, and are often fitted with shirts of infernal chainmail. Hell hounds cannot speak, but understand Infernal.\n\nThe hell hound was ranked ninth among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of \'\'Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies\'\'.
