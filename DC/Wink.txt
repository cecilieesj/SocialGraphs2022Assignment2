However, it is ambiguous by itself and highly dependent upon additional context, without which a wink could become misinterpreted or even nonsensical. For example, in some regions of the world, a wink may be considered rude or offensive. And depending on the relationship of the people involved, a wink could possibly constitute a sexual gesture.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=World without words|last=Schroevers|first=Sander|publisher=Hogeschool van Amsterdam|year=2012|isbn=9789079646111|location=Hoofddorp|pages=44}}</ref><ref name=":1" />\n\n==General overview and meanings==\nWinking<ref>{{cite web|url=http://able2know.org/topic/38829-1|title=What is the Meaning of a Wink--USA and Elsewhere?|website=Able2know.org|access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref> is one of the more subtle gestures, usually involving eye contact between those involved. In most cases it is only meant to be known by the sender and their intended receivers, but in some cases can be more widely intended.\n\n===Single wink===\n[[File:Een avondje teevee met André - André van Duin 007.jpg|thumb|Dutch comedian [[André van Duin]] performing a single wink]]\nA single wink is usually a friendly gesture implying a degree of solidarity or intimacy.\n\nA typical use of the wink is to quietly send a message that third parties are not aware of. For example, while person A is lying to person B or deliberately teasing them, they might wink at person C as a means of indicating the fact to C and incorporating them in the "conspiracy". Alternatively, if person A is joking or teasing person B in a friendly way, person A may wink directly at person B as a way to suggest to them that their own (A\'s) words are to be taken as a joke. It is also possible for person A to use winking in order to secretly imply to person B that the words or actions of some third party should not be taken seriously (for example, because the third party is joking or lying).\n\nA wink could also be used as a somewhat humorous way to express sympathy, solidarity, and encouragement, especially when the winker is trying to put the receiver at ease in a situation where they might feel nervous or uncomfortable. In such cases a wink has a meaning very similar to that of a "[[Thumbs up (gesture)|thumbs up]]".\n\nIn some cultures it is often a sexual interest, or flirtatious manner, during momentary eye contact. This is often followed by a smile and usually a smile from the receiver if it is accepted or approved by them, sometimes combined with blushing if they are embarrassed. A smile from the receiver sometimes—but not always—indicates (sexual) interest in the winker. For example, in the [[Wodaabe]] tribe in the Niger area, someone who wants to engage in sexual activities can wink at a person. If the person continues to look at them, they will slightly move their lip corner, showing the way to the bush the person is expected to have sex with them in.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beckwith|first1=Carol|title=Niger\'s Wodaabe: People of the taboo|journal=National Geographic|date=1983|volume=164|issue=4|pages=483–59}}</ref>\n\nIn particularly difficult or strenuous situations, Person A may wink at Person B to non-verbally communicate that Person B can trust Person C. An extreme example of this could be undercover cops when one does something otherwise questionable.\n\n===Double wink ===\nLike a single wink but more emphatic, two winks in a row may be used by the sender as a subtle way to imply that something said by the sender, immediately beforehand, was "sneaky", "tricky", "misleading", or "untrue" to the receiver. In English-speaking countries, this has also given rise to the expression of vocally saying "wink wink" while winking—or sometimes while not even winking at all, in which case the sender is not communicating the "trickiness" of their words to a third party, but to the receiver, and is thus signalling that their words should not be taken literally but as a hint or [[euphemism]].\n\n===Both eyes (bat/flutter)===\nTo close and open, or "wink", both eyes is usually an involuntary action known as a "[[blink]]". Though if done intentionally, in a particular way (such as once slowly or a few times in a row quickly), while giving a sweet or suggestive look with the eyes, often with the head tilted or at an angle in combination with the shoulders, is known as to "bat an eyelash", "bat/batting eyelashes", or "flutter/fluttering eyelashes". This is done as a way of flirting, showing interest, or in an attempt to persuade the receiver. It may also be used ironically in certain situations. If person A says something outrageous, or obviously a lie. Person B will "bat their eyelash" at person C, letting person C know that they think what person A said was foolish, lazy, obvious, etc. It depends on the context.\n\n==Cultural specific differences==\n\n===The [[Western world]] (including Eastern Europe and Latin America)===\n[[File:Patti_labelle_2002.jpg|thumb|[[Patti LaBelle]] winking]]\nWinking in Western culture can be used as a way of letting someone else know that the winker or some other person is joking or lying (e.g., a parent tells their child a story about a fairy princess, and then winks at the child\'s older sibling, the sibling thus knows the parent is lying to the younger child). It may also be used to communicate sexual intentions, ranging from flirtation to an explicit invitation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Intercultural Communication: Identities in a Global Community|last=Jandt|first=Fred|publisher=SAGE|year=2012|isbn=9781412992879|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=119}}</ref><ref name=non>{{cite web\n |title        = Non-verbal communication\n |url          = http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=4.6.0.htm&module=provider&language=English\n |website      = Erc.msh.org\n |access-date   = 2008-02-04\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216192220/http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=4.6.0.htm&module=provider&language=English\n |archive-date = 16 February 2008\n |url-status     = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Asia===\nIn China and reportedly to some extent in India, winking to anyone other than family or a friend who a person wishes to have sex with may be seen as an offensive or at least an impolite gesture.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2008/10/sarah-palins-wi.html|title=Sarah Palin\'s wink will offend in India and China|date=5 October 2008|website=Latimesblogs.latimes.com|access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Field Guide to Stains: How to Identify and Remove Virtually Every Stain Known to Man|last=Friedman|first=Virginia|last2=Wagner|first2=Melissa|last3=Armstrong|first3=Nancy|publisher=Quirk Books|year=2003|isbn=978-1931686204|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetogest0000arms/page/106 106]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetogest0000arms/page/106}}</ref> This is demonstrated in the commotion<ref name=":0" /> caused by [[Sarah Palin]] in a number of Asian countries during the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2008|2008 vice presidential debate]], where she winked<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-et-wink14-2008oct14-story.html|title=Sarah Palin stirs up controversy in the wink of an eye|last=Fiore|first=Faye|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-06-28}}</ref> several times while debating [[Joe Biden]].

It can be used to signal an "inside" joke, a sly gesture shared between two people privately, unbeknownst to those around them, as in a social gathering. It can also be a naughty "come on" towards the attractive sex.\n\n===Africa===\n[[West Africa]]n parents may wink to signal children to leave the room, especially when there is a guest, or another adult coming in. It is considered rude for children to stay in a room where adults or elders want to have a conversation, and so winking is used as a more discreet way to tell the children to leave the room. Parents also try not to embarrass themselves in front of guests, because their children do not understand immediately when it is time to leave the room.<ref name=non /><ref name="LAT">{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2008/10/sarah-palins-wi.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=All The Rage | date=2008-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==Noted examples==\n*In the famous [[Monty Python]] sketch [[Nudge Nudge]], a younger man slyly asks an older gentleman about [[sexual intercourse|sex]] through [[innuendo]], reiterating the phrase "nudge nudge wink wink" after his questions in an attempt to indicate that his innocent-sounding questions are intended to be [[double entendre]]s, i.e., of a sexual nature.\n*During the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2008|2008 United States vice-presidential debate]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Sarah Palin]] winked at the audience several times.

Dogs are said to wink as a sign of non-aggression due to the fact they see extended eye contact as a challenge for dominance. So, when dogs don’t want to fight, they will wink/blink in submission.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Winking: Why we do it, what it means |url=https://www.allaboutvision.com/resources/why-people-wink/ |access-date=2022-05-19 |website=All About Vision |language=en-us}}</ref> \n\nAlthough usually blinking slowly to show affection, cats are also more rarely known to wink to humans and other cats, communicating that it sees the other as trustworthy.
