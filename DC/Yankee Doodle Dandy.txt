Cohan]], known as "The Man Who Owned Broadway".<ref>{{IBDB name|5829|George M. Cohan}}</ref> It stars [[James Cagney]], [[Joan Leslie]], [[Walter Huston]], and [[Richard Whorf]], and features [[Irene Manning]], [[George Tobias]], [[Rosemary DeCamp]], [[Jeanne Cagney]], and Vera Lewis. Joan Leslie\'s singing voice was partially dubbed by [[Sally Sweetland]].\n\nThe film was written by [[Robert Buckner]] and Edmund Joseph, and directed by [[Michael Curtiz]].  According to the special edition DVD, significant and uncredited improvements were made to the script by the twin brothers [[Julius J. Epstein]] and [[Philip G. Epstein]]. The film was a major hit for [[Warner Brothers]], and was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning three.\n\nIn 1993, \'\'Yankee Doodle Dandy\'\'  was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant", and in 1998, the film was included on the [[American Film Institute]]\'s \'\'[[AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]]\'\' list, a compilation of the 100 greatest films in American cinema.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early days of [[World War II]], Cohan comes out of retirement to star as President Roosevelt in the [[Rodgers and Hart]] musical \'\'[[I\'d Rather Be Right]].\'\' On the first night, he is summoned to meet the president at the [[White House]], who presents him with a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] (though the Cohan character on screen incorrectly identifies the award as the [[Congressional Medal of Honor]]). Cohan is overcome and chats with Roosevelt, recalling his early days on the stage. The film flashes back to his supposed birth on July 4, whilst his father is performing on the [[vaudeville]] stage.\n\nCohan and his sister join the family act as soon as they learn to dance, and soon The Four Cohans are performing successfully. But George gets too cocky as he grows up and is blacklisted by theatrical producers for being troublesome. He leaves the act and hawks his songs unsuccessfully to producers. In partnership with [[Sam H. Harris|Sam Harris]], another struggling writer, he finally interests a producer and they are on the road to success. He also marries Mary, a young singer/dancer.\n\nAs his star ascends, he persuades his now struggling parents to join his act, eventually vesting some of his valuable theatrical properties in their name.\n\nCohan retires, but returns to the stage several times, culminating in the role of the U.S. president. As he leaves the White House, after receiving the Congressional Gold Medal from the president, he descends a set of stairs while performing a tap dance (which Cagney thought up before the scene was filmed and undertook without rehearsal). Outside, he joins a military parade, where the soldiers are singing "[[Over There]]", and, at first, he isn\'t singing. Not knowing that Cohan is the song\'s composer, one of them asks if he knows the words. Cohan\'s response is a smile before joining in.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[James Cagney]] as [[George M.

Cohan, who admired [[Fred Astaire]]\'s work, let it be known that he preferred Astaire, who also bore a passing resemblance to him, to star in his life story. Warners offered the role to Astaire first, but he turned it down because Cohan\'s eccentric, stiff-legged dancing was far removed from Astaire\'s own, more fluid, style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfilmboy.com/2013/04/james-cagney-blogathon-yankee-doodle.html|title=Loading...|website=Classicfilmboy.com|access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n*James Cagney reprised the role of George M. Cohan in the movie \'\'[[The Seven Little Foys]]\'\' (1955), but only on the condition that he receive no money: He did the film as a tribute to [[Eddie Foy, Sr.|Eddie Foy]].  In \'\'Yankee Doodle Dandy\'\', [[Eddie Foy, Jr.]] played the role of his own father.  In \'\'The Seven Little Foys\'\', [[Bob Hope]] portrayed Foy; Charley Foy (brother of Eddie Foy, Jr.) served as a narrator.\n*Actress Jeanne Cagney, who played the part of Cohan\'s sister, was James Cagney\'s real-life sister. Cagney\'s brother, William Cagney, was the Associate Producer of the film.\n*Rosemary DeCamp, who played the mother of George M. Cohan, was, in fact, 11 years younger than Cagney.\n*President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was played by Captain Jack Young, a lookalike who is seen only from the back. An impressionist, [[Art Gilmore]], provided the voice of Roosevelt, uncredited. Gilmore would narrate the [[Joe McDoakes]] film shorts produced by Warners, and became a well-known announcer on television through the 1970s.\n* Uncredited cast members include [[Eddie Acuff]], [[Murray Alper]], [[Ward Bond]], [[Walter Brooke]], [[Georgia Carroll]], [[Glen Cavender]], [[Spencer Charters]], [[Wallis Clark]], [[William B.

Cohan]] performing "[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]]" from \'\'[[Little Johnny Jones]]\'\'<ref>{{ibdb show|5456|Little Johnny Jones}}</ref>]]\n\n==Background and production==\nCagney, like Cohan, was an [[Irish-American]] who had been a song-and-dance man early in his career. His unique and seemingly odd presentation style, of half-singing and half-reciting the songs, reflected the style that Cohan himself used.  His natural dance style and physique were also a good match for Cohan. Newspapers at the time reported that Cagney intended to consciously imitate Cohan\'s song-and-dance style, but to play the normal part of the acting in his own style. Although director Curtiz was known as a taskmaster, he also gave his actors some latitude. Cagney and other players came up with a number of "bits of business", as Cagney called them, meaning improvised lines or action in theater parlance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cengage.com/resource_uploads/static_resources/0495898074/24712/learning_lingo.html|title=Learning the Lingo|website=Cengage.com|access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nA number of the biographical particulars of the movie are [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]]-ized fiction, such as omitting the fact that Cohan divorced and remarried, combining Cohan\'s two wives, Ethel and Agnes, into a single character named Mary, and taking some liberties with the chronology of Cohan\'s life and the order of his parents\' deaths. In one scene, after Cohan suffers a flop with an atypical non-musical drama, \'\'Popularity\'\', he composes a telegram apologizing to the public. He then walks out of the [[Western Union]] office to find newspaper sellers announcing the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|torpedoing of the \'\'Lusitania\'\']]. In reality, the failed play was staged in 1906, and the Lusitania\'s sinking occurred in 1915.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/george-m-cohan-5829|title=George M. Cohan – Broadway Cast & Staff &#124; IBDB}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, care was taken to make the sets, costumes, and dance steps match the original stage presentations. Twice, Cagney sprained an ankle while mastering Cohan\'s stiff-legged dance style. This effort was aided significantly by a former associate of Cohan\'s, Jack Boyle, who knew the original productions well. Boyle also appeared in the film in some of the dancing groups.\n\nCagney, as Cohan, is shown performing as a singing and dancing version of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Although it was well known, the reality of Roosevelt\'s use of a wheelchair after [[polio]] was not emphasized at the time. In the film, Roosevelt never leaves his chair when meeting Cohan.\n\nCohan himself served as a consultant during the production of the film, as well as being credited with the incidental score. Due to his failing health, his actual involvement in the film was limited. But when completed, the film was privately screened for Cohan and he commented on Cagney\'s performance: "My God, what an act to follow!"<ref>Ebert, Roger. [https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-yankee-doodle-dandy-1942 "\'\'Yankee Doodle Dandy\'\' (1942)"], RogerEbert.com, July 5, 1998, accessed July 4, 2011</ref>\n\nBecause of Cohan\'s failing health, Warner Brothers moved up the scheduled gala premiere from July 4 to May 29; the original date had been chosen because of the film\'s patriotic theme and because in the movie, Cohan is said to have been born on the Fourth of July, as he wrote in the lyrics of his song, "Yankee Doodle Dandy." (However, Cohan was actually born on July 3.)  In the end, Cohan lived for several more months after the film\'s release.\n\nThe [[movie poster]] for this film was the first ever produced by noted poster designer [[Bill Gold]].\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# \'\'\'"Overture"\'\'\' – Played by Orchestra behind titles.\n# \'\'\'"Keep Your Eyes Upon Me (The Dancing Master)"\'\'\' – Sung and Danced by Walter Huston, then Sung and Danced by Henry Blair.\n# \'\'\'"[[While Strolling Through the Park One Day]]"\'\'\' – Sung and Danced by Jo Ann Marlowe.\n# \'\'\'"At a Georgia Camp Meeting"\'\'\' – Danced by James Cagney, Walter Huston, Rosemary DeCamp and Jeanne Cagney.\n# \'\'\'"I Was Born in Virginia"\'\'\' – Sung and Danced by James Cagney, Jeanne Cagney, Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp.\n# \'\'\'"The Warmest Baby in the Bunch"\'\'\' – Sung and Danced by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# \'\'\'"[[Harrigan (song)|Harrigan]]"\'\'\' – Sung and Danced by James Cagney and Joan Leslie.\n# \'\'\'"[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]]"\'\'\' – Sung and Danced by James Cagney, Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland) and Chorus.\n# \'\'\'"[[Give My Regards To Broadway]]"\'\'\' – Sung and Danced by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# \'\'\'"Oh You Wonderful Girl / Blue Skies, Gray Skies / The Belle of the Barbers\' Ball"\'\'\' – Sung by James Cagney, Jeanne Cagney, Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp.\n# \'\'\'"[[Mary\'s a Grand Old Name]]"\'\'\' – Sung by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# \'\'\'"[[Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway]]"\'\'\' – Sung by James Cagney.\n# \'\'\'"[[Mary\'s a Grand Old Name]]"\'\'\' (reprise 1) – Sung by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# \'\'\'"[[Mary\'s a Grand Old Name]]"\'\'\' (reprise 2) – Sung by Irene Manning.\n# \'\'\'"[[Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway]]"\'\'\' (reprise) – Sung by Chorus.\n# \'\'\'"So Long, Mary"\'\'\' – Sung by Irene Manning and Chorus.\n# \'\'\'"[[You\'re a Grand Old Flag]]"\'\'\' – Performed by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# \'\'\'"Like the Wandering Minstrel"\'\'\' – Sung by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# \'\'\'"[[Over There]]"\'\'\' – Sung by Frances Langford, James Cagney and Chorus.\n# \'\'\'"A George M.

Cohan\'s life, having disliked Cohan since the [[1919 Actors\' Equity Association strike|Actors\' Equity Strike in 1919]], in which he sided with the producers. In 1940, Cagney was named, along with 15 other Hollywood figures, in the grand jury testimony of John R. Leech, the self-described \'chief functionary\' of the Los Angeles Communist Party who had been subpoenaed by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]]. \'\'[[The New York Times]]\'\' printed the allegation that Cagney was a communist on its front page. Cagney refuted the accusation and [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] made a statement to the press clearing Cagney. [[William Cagney]], one of the film\'s producers, is reported to have said to his brother that "we\'re going to have to make the goddamndest patriotic picture that\'s ever been made. I think it\'s the Cohan story".<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGilligan|first1=Patrick|title=Cagney: The Actor as Auteur|date=1982|publisher=A.S.
