One of the platters on the table serves human babies (illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]]).]]\n\nAn \'\'\'ogre\'\'\' ([[grammatical gender|feminine]]: \'\'\'ogress\'\'\') is a legendary [[monster]] usually depicted as a large, hideous, [[Mythic humanoids|man-like being]] that eats ordinary human beings, especially infants and children.<ref>{{cite book|title=Why do Ogres Eat Babies?|first=Marina|last=Warner|publisher=SpringerLink|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-13816-6_18}}</ref> Ogres frequently feature in [[mythology]], [[folklore]], and [[fiction]] throughout the world. They appear in many classic works of [[literature]], and are most often associated in [[fairy tales]] and legend with a taste for infants.\n\nIn mythology, ogres are often depicted as inhumanly large, tall, and having a disproportionately large head, abundant hair, unusually colored skin, a voracious appetite, and a strong body. Ogres are closely linked with giants and with human cannibals in mythology. In both folklore and fiction, giants are often given ogrish traits (such as the giants in "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]" and "[[Jack the Giant Killer]]", the Giant Despair in \'\'[[The Pilgrim\'s Progress]]\'\', and the [[Jötunn]] of [[Norse mythology]]); while ogres may be given giant-like traits.\n\nFamous examples of ogres in folklore include the ogre in "[[Puss in Boots]]" and the ogre in "[[Hop-o\'-My-Thumb]]". Other characters sometimes described as ogres include the title character from "[[Bluebeard]]", the Beast from \'\'[[Beauty and the Beast]]\'\', [[Humbaba]] from the \'\'[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]\'\', [[Grendel]] from \'\'[[Beowulf]]\'\', [[Polyphemus]] the [[Cyclops]] from [[Homer]]\'s \'\'[[Odyssey]]\'\', the Man-eating giant in "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]", the [[Oni]] of [[Japanese folklore]] and the [[Ghouls]] of [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia| pre-Islamic Arabian religion]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Le Chat face à l\'ogre.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Puss in Boots]] before the ogre (illustrated by [[Walter Crane]]).]]\n\nThe word \'\'ogre\'\' is of [[French language|French]] origin, originally derived from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] god [[Orcus]], who fed on human flesh. Its earliest attestation is in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]\' late 12th-century verse romance [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|\'\'Perceval, li contes del graal\'\']], which contains the lines:\n{{quotation|\n\'\'Et s\'est escrit que il ert ancore<br />\n\'\'que toz li reaumes de Logres,<br />\n\'\'qui jadis fu la terre as ogres,<br />\n\'\'ert destruite par cele lance.<br />\n<br />\n"And it is written that he will come again,<br />\nto all the realms of [[Logres]],<br />\nwhich was formerly land of ogres,<br />\nand destroy them with that lance."\n}}\nThe \'\'ogres\'\' in this rhyme may refer to the ogres who were, in the [[pseudohistorical]] work \'\'[[History of the Kings of Britain]]\'\' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], the inhabitants of Britain prior to human settlement. The Italian author [[Giambattista Basile]] (1575–1632) used the related [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] word \'\'uerco\'\', or in standard [[Italian language|Italian]], \'\'orco\'\' in some of his tales. This word is documented<ref>[http://vocabolario.biblio.cribecu.sns.it/cgi-bin/Vocabolario/search_context?rimando=1&pattern=ORCO.&tag_n=ENTRY&attr_n=ID&attr_v=W288 Vocabolario Degli Accademici Della Crusca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013191225/http://vocabolario.biblio.cribecu.sns.it/cgi-bin/Vocabolario/search_context?rimando=1&pattern=ORCO.&tag_n=ENTRY&attr_n=ID&attr_v=W288 |date=2007-10-13 }}</ref> in earlier Italian works ([[Italian literature#Imitators|Fazio degli Uberti]], 14th century; [[Luigi Pulci]], 15th century; [[Ludovico Ariosto]], 15th–16th centuries) and has even older cognates with the Latin \'\'orcus\'\' and the Old English \'\'orcnēas\'\' found in [[Beowulf]] lines 112–113, which inspired [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]\'s \'\'[[Orc#Early Modern|Orc]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~beowulf/main.html |title=Beowulf |publisher=Humanities.mcmaster.ca |access-date=2012-03-28}}</ref> All these words may derive from a shared Indo-European mythological concept (as Tolkien himself speculated, as cited by [[Tom Shippey]], \'\'The Road to Middle-earth\'\', 45). The Dictionary of the Academy of France alternatively states that the name is derived from the word \'\'Hongrois\'\', which means [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], as of western cultures referred to Hungarians as a kind of monstrosity.<ref>Dictionnaire de l\'Académie française (1932–35)</ref> Ogre could possibly also derive{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} from the biblical [[Og]], last of the giants (or from the Greek river god [[Oeagrus|Oiagros]], father of [[Orpheus]]).\n\nThe word \'\'ogre\'\' came into wider usage in the works of [[Charles Perrault]] (1628–1703) or [[Madame d\'Aulnoy|Marie-Catherine Jumelle de Berneville, Comtesse d\' Aulnoy]] (1650–1705), both of whom were French authors. The first appearance of the word \'\'ogre\'\' in Perrault\'s work occurred in his \'\'Histoires ou Contes du temps Passé\'\' (1696). It later appeared in several of his other fairy tales, many of which were based on the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] tales of Basile. The first example of a female ogre being referred to as an \'\'ogress\'\' is found in his version of \'\'[[Sleeping Beauty]]\'\', where it is spelled \'\'ogresse.\'\' [[Madame d\'Aulnoy]] first employed the word \'\'ogre\'\' in her story \'\'[[The Bee and the Orange Tree|L\'Orangier et l\'Abeille]]\'\' (1698), and was the first to use the word \'\'ogree\'\' to refer to the creature\'s offspring.\n\n== Fairy tales that feature ogres ==\n[[File:Poucet11.jpg|thumb|[[Hop-o\'-My-Thumb]] steals the ogre\'s [[seven-league boots]] (illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]], 1862).]]\n\n* \'\'[[Hop-o\'-My-Thumb]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Puss in Boots]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Sleeping Beauty]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[The Bee and the Orange Tree]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Finette Cendron]]\'\' or \'\'Cunning Cinders\'\'\n* \'\'[[Bearskin (French fairy tale)|Bearskin]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Tale of the Ogre]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[The Flea (fairy tale)|The Flea]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[The Enchanted Doe]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Violet (fairy tale)|Violet]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[The Dove (fairy tale)|The Dove]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Corvetto (fairy tale)|Corvetto]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[The Three Crowns]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Liisa and the Prince]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Puss-cat Mew]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales|The Selfish Giant]]\'\'\n* \'\'[[Garulfo]]\'\'\n\n== Ogres in popular culture ==\n{{Pop culture|date=March 2018}}\n*All kinds of ogres appear in \'\'[[Inuyasha]]\'\' as oni.\n* Ogres appear as antagonists in the 1996 video game \'\'[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]\'\'.\n* Ogres appear as a player class in the Popular MMORPG \'\'[[EverQuest]]\'\'.\n* Ogres are attackable NPCs in the MMORPG \'\'[[RuneScape]]\'\'.\n* Nish and two other Ogres appear in the 2004 film \'\'[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]\'\'.\n* Ogres appear as antagonists in the 2018 video game \'\'[[God of War (2018)|God of War]]\'\', despite not being traditionally associated with Norse mythology. \n* Ogres exist as a major faction in \'\'[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]\'\', where they ruled over parts of the world in kingdoms inspired by the Mongol Empire, while in its successor \'\'[[Warhammer: Age of Sigmar]]\'\', they are largely roaming tribes. In both, they are ravenously hungry and famed for eating the flesh of other beings. In \'\'[[Warhammer 40,000]]\'\', a subset of humanity has evolved to become enormously tall, unintelligent, and often very fat, named \'Ogryn\', in reference to Ogres. \n*[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] is the eponymous ogre protagonist in the \'\'[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]] \'\'series of comedy films. Shrek engages in typical ogre behaviors like washing in mud and eating slugs, but otherwise is not monstrous. He only feigns nastiness and claims to eat people as a way to deter trespassers in his [[swamp]], which is the backbone of the first film\'s plot. He also appears to simply enjoy scaring people, due to years of being mistreated by humans simply for the fact he is an ogre and not because he ever did anything. Ogres in the Shrek series are portrayed as having about the same intelligence levels as humans and are not much different than humans aside from appearance and rather disgusting habits.\n** Ironically, no ogre appears in the 2011 spin-off film \'\'[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]\'\'.\n* An ogre named Mulgarath is the main antagonist in \'\'[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]\'\', wherein the [[shapeshifting]] ability from the "Puss in Boots" story is shared by all ogres.\n* Ogres are units for the [[Orc]] faction in \'\'[[Warlords Battlecry]]\'\' video games.\n* Ogres are a barbaric race in the \'\'[[Warcraft]]\'\' franchise. One of its main characters, Rexxar, is a half-[[orc]], half-ogre.\n* Ogres are enemies in \'\'[[The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion]]\'\', and \'\'[[The Elder Scrolls Online]]\'\'.\n* Ogres are fourth-level creatures of the Stronghold faction in the \'\'[[Heroes of Might and Magic III]].\'\'\n* Ogres make an appearance as [[shock troops]] and [[pillagers]] from Mount Gundabad in \'\'[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]\'\'.\n* Ogres are a race in the \'\'[[Dungeons & Dragons]]\'\' [[role-playing game]].\n* Ogres are the monsters in \'\'[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]\'\' issue #2 story "Ogre\'s Castle".\n* Ogrest from the Dofus / Wakfu-Games / Anime.
