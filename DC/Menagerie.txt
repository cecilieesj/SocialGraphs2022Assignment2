Later, it came to be used primarily in reference to [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] or royal animal collections. The French-language \'\'Methodical Encyclopaedia\'\' of 1782 defines a menagerie as an "establishment of luxury and curiosity". Later on, the term referred also to travelling animal collections that exhibited wild animals at fairs across [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]].\n\n==Aristocratic menageries==\n[[Image:towrlndn.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Tower of London]] housed [[England]]\'s royal menagerie for several centuries (Picture from the 15th century, [[British Library]]).]]\nA menagerie was mostly connected with an aristocratic or royal court and was situated within a garden or park of a palace. These aristocrats wanted to illustrate their power and wealth by displaying exotic animals which were uncommon, difficult to acquire, and expensive to maintain in a living and active state.\n\nThe aristocratic menageries are distinguished from the later zoological garden (zoos) since they were founded and owned by aristocrats whose intentions were not primarily of scientific and educational interest.<ref>Yes, definitely</ref>\n\n===Medieval period and Renaissance===\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], several sovereigns across Europe maintained menageries at their royal courts. An early example is that of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century. His three menageries, at [[Aachen]], [[Nijmegen]] and [[Ingelheim am Rhein|Ingelheim]], located in present-day [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], housed the first elephants seen in Europe since the [[Roman Empire]], along with monkeys, lions, bears, camels, falcons, and many exotic birds.\nCharlemagne received exotic animals for his collection as gifts from rulers of Africa and Asia.<ref name=Fisher40>[[James Fisher (naturalist)|Fisher, James]], \'\'Zoos of the World: The Story of Animals in Captivity\'\', Aldus Book, London, 1966, p. 40.</ref>\nIn 797, the [[caliph]] of [[Baghdad]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an Asian elephant named [[Abul-Abbas]].

The prominent feature of Baroque menageries was the circular layout, in the middle of which stood a beautiful pavilion. Around this pavilion was a walking path and outside this path were the enclosures and cages.

In 1752 [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] erected his famous Baroque menagerie in the park of [[Schönbrunn Palace]] near [[Vienna]]. \nBeing at first a courtly menagerie with private character it was opened to the general public in 1779. Initially, it was only open for "respectably dressed persons".\n\nAnother aristocratic menagerie was founded in 1774 by [[Charles III of Spain]] on grounds which were part of the gardens of the [[Parque del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro]] Palace in [[Madrid]].\nDuring two centuries, it was a predecessor institution of the modern facilities of the [[Zoo Aquarium de Madrid|Madrid Zoo Aquarium]], moved in 1972 to the [[Casa de Campo]].<ref>Historic Madrid: [http://www.turismomadrid.es/INGL/HIST/pagina/HISTLaCasaDeFieras/HISTLaCasaDeFieras.htm The Wild Animal House in the Retiro Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108100313/http://www.turismomadrid.es/INGL/HIST/pagina/HISTLaCasaDeFieras/HISTLaCasaDeFieras.htm |date=2009-01-08 }}.</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century the aristocratic menageries were displaced by the modern [[zoological garden]]s with their [[science|scientific]] and [[education]]al approach. The last menagerie in Europe was the [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn]] in Vienna, which was known officially as a "menagerie" until 1924, before evolving into a modern zoological garden with a scientific, educational and [[conservation biology|conservationist]] orientation. Due to its local continuity, the former menagerie established in the medieval through baroque tradition of private wild-animal collections of princes and kings, is often seen as the oldest remaining zoo in the world. Although many of the old Baroque enclosures have been changed, one can still obtain a good impression of the symmetrical ensemble of the formerly imperial menagerie.\n\n==Travelling menageries==\n{{main|Travelling menagerie}}\nIn [[England]] travelling menageries had first appeared at around 1700.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In contrast to the aristocratic menageries, these travelling animal collections were run by [[showman|showmen]] who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population.  These animal shows ranged in size but the largest was [[George Wombwell]]\'s. The earliest record of a fatality at one such travelling menagerie was the death of [[Hannah Twynnoy]] in 1703 who was killed by a tiger in [[Malmesbury, Wiltshire|Malmesbury]], [[Wiltshire]].\nAlso in [[North America]] travelling menageries became even more popular during that time.\n\nThe first exotic animal known to have been exhibited in America was a lion, in [[Boston]] in 1710, followed a year later in the same city by a camel.<ref name=Kisling147-150/>\nA sailor arrived in [[Philadelphia]] in August 1727 with another lion, which he exhibited in the city and surrounding towns for eight years.<ref name=Hancocks86-87>Hancocks, David, \'\'A different nature: The paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future\'\', University of California Press, Berkeley, 2001, pp.86-87. {{ISBN|0-520-21879-5}}</ref>\nThe first [[Asian elephant|elephant]] was imported from [[India]] to America by a ship’s captain, Jacob Crowninshield, in 1796.

Unlike their [[Europe]]an counterparts, America’s menageries and [[circus]]es had combined as single travelling shows, with one ticket to see both. This increased the size and the diversity of their collections.
