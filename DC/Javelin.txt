Bronze, Laconian style, third quarter of the 6th century BC]]\n\nA \'\'\'javelin\'\'\' is a light [[spear]] designed primarily to be thrown, historically as a [[ranged weapon]], but today predominantly for sport. The javelin is almost always thrown by hand, unlike the [[sling (weapon)|sling]], [[bow and arrow|bow]], and [[crossbow]], which launch projectiles with the aid of a hand-held mechanism. However, devices do exist to assist the javelin thrower in achieving greater distance, such as [[spear-thrower]]s or the [[amentum]].\n\nA warrior or soldier armed primarily with one or more javelins is a \'\'\'javelineer\'\'\'.\n\nThe word javelin comes from [[Middle English]] and it derives from [[Old French]] \'\'javelin\'\', a diminutive of \'\'javelot\'\', which meant spear. The word \'\'javelot\'\' probably originated from one of the [[Celtic languages]].\n\n==Prehistory==\nThere is archaeological evidence that javelins and [[throwing stick]]s were already in use by the last phase of the [[Lower Paleolithic]]. Seven spear-like objects were found in a coal mine in the city of [[Schöningen]], Germany. [[Stratigraphy|Stratigraphic]] dating indicates that the weapons are about 400,000 years old.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Electron microscopic characterization of cell wall degradation of the 400,000-year-old wooden Schöningen spears|journal=Holz Als Roh- und Werkstoff|volume=63|issue=2|pages=118–122|doi=10.1007/s00107-004-0542-6|year=2005|last1=Schmitt|first1=U.|last2=Singh|first2=A.

They were manufactured with the maximum thickness and weight situated at the front end of the wooden shaft. The frontal centre of gravity suggests that these weapons were used as javelins. A fossilized horse shoulder blade with a projectile wound, dated to 500,000 years ago, was revealed in a gravel quarry in the village of [[Boxgrove]], England. Studies suggested that the wound was probably caused by a javelin.<ref>[http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/punctured-horse-shoulder-blade Punctured Horse Shoulder Blade | The Smithsonian Institution\'s Human Origins Program<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prehistoric/past/past26.html The Prehistoric Society – Past No. 26<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.archaeology.org/9705/newsbriefs/spears.html World\'s Oldest Spears<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Classical age==\n[[Image:Agrianian3.jpg|thumb|Agrianian peltast.

It was lighter in weight than that used by other nations. He describes the Ancient Egyptian javelin\'s features:\n\n<blockquote>It consisted of a long thin shaft, sometimes merely pointed, but generally armed with a head, which was either leaf-shaped, or like the head of a spear, or else four-sided, and attached to the shaft by projections at the angles.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hE_OAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA1|title=History of Ancient Egypt|last=Rawlinson|first=George|date=1882|publisher=S.

Attributed to the painter of the Brussels Oinochoes.]]\nThe [[peltast]]s, usually serving as [[skirmishers]], were armed with several javelins, often with [[amentum|throwing straps]] to increase stand-off power. The peltasts hurled their javelins at the enemy\'s heavier troops, the [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation|phalanx]], in order to break their lines so that their own army\'s hoplites could destroy the weakened enemy formation. In the [[battle of Lechaeum]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] general [[Iphicrates]] took advantage of the fact that a [[Sparta]]n hoplite phalanx operating near [[Corinth]] was moving in the open field without the protection of any missile-throwing troops. He decided to ambush it with his force of peltasts. By launching repeated hit-and-run attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half. This marked the first recorded occasion in ancient Greek military history in which a force entirely made up of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites.\n\nThe [[thureophoroi]] and [[thorakitai]], who gradually replaced the peltasts, carried javelins in addition to a long thrusting [[spear]] and a [[short sword]].\n\nJavelins were often used as an effective hunting weapon, the strap adding enough power to take down large game. Javelins were also used in the [[Ancient Olympics]] and other [[Panhellenic Games|Panhellenic games]]. They were hurled in a certain direction and whoever hurled it the farthest, as long as it hit tip-first, won that game.\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n\n{{Main|Pilum}}\n\n====Republic and early empire====\n[[Image:Pilum lg.jpg|thumb|left| [[Anastylosis|Reconstruction]] of a [[Marian reforms|post-Marian]] pilum]]\n\nIn 387 BC, the [[Gauls]] invaded Italy, inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[military establishment of the Roman Republic|Roman Republican army]], and sacked Rome. After this defeat, the Romans undertook a comprehensive reform of their army and changed the basic tactical formation from the Greek-style phalanx armed with the \'\'[[Hasta (spear)|hasta]]\'\' spear and the \'\'[[clipeus]]\'\' [[round shield]] to a more flexible three-line formation. The \'\'[[hastati]]\'\' stood in the first line, the \'\'[[principes]]\'\' in the second line and the \'\'[[triarii]]\'\' in the third line. While the \'\'triarii\'\' were still armed with \'\'hastae\'\', the \'\'hastati\'\' and the \'\'principes\'\' were rearmed with short swords and heavy javelins. Each soldier from the \'\'hastati\'\' and \'\'principes\'\' lines carried two javelins. This heavy javelin, known as a \'\'[[pilum]]\'\' (plural \'\'pila\'\'), was about two metres long overall, consisting of an iron shank, about 7&nbsp;mm in diameter and 60&nbsp;cm long, with pyramidal head, secured to a wooden shaft. The iron shank was either socketed or, more usually, widened to a flat [[Tang (tools)|tang]]. A \'\'pilum\'\' usually weighed between {{convert|2|and|5|lb|kg|1}},{{Citation needed|reason=2 to 5 pounds seems too heavy|date=April 2019}} with the versions produced during the [[Roman Empire|empire]] being somewhat lighter. Pictorial evidence suggests that some versions of the weapon were weighted with a lead ball at the base of the shank in order to increase penetrative power, but no archaeological specimens have been found.<ref>Connolly, 1998, p. 233.</ref> Recent experiments have shown \'\'pila\'\' to have a range of about 30 metres, although the effective range is only 15 to 20 metres. \'\'Pila\'\' were sometimes referred to as "javelins", but the archaic term for the javelin was "\'\'[[verutum]]\'\'".\n\nFrom the third century BC, the Roman legion added a skirmisher type of soldier to its tactical formation. The \'\'[[velites]]\'\' were light infantry armed with short swords (the \'\'[[gladius]]\'\' or \'\'[[pugio]]\'\'), small round shields, and several small javelins. These javelins were called "\'\'veruta\'\'" (singular \'\'verutum\'\'). The \'\'velites\'\' typically drew near the enemy, hurled javelins against their formation, and then retreated behind the legion\'s heavier infantry. The \'\'velites\'\' were considered highly effective in turning back [[war elephants]], on account of discharging a hail of javelins at some range and not presenting a "block" that could be trampled on or otherwise smashed – unlike the close-order infantry behind them. At the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202 BC, the javelin-throwing \'\'velites\'\' proved their worth and were no doubt critical in helping to herd Hannibal\'s war elephants through the formation to be slaughtered. The \'\'velites\'\' would slowly have been either disbanded or re-equipped as more-heavily armed legionaries from the time when [[Gaius Marius]] and other Roman generals reorganised the army in the late second and early first centuries BC. Their role would most likely have been taken by irregular auxiliary troops as the republic expanded overseas. The \'\'[[verutum]]\'\' was a cheaper missile weapon than the \'\'pilum\'\'. The \'\'verutum\'\' was a short-range weapon, with a simply made head of soft iron.\n\n[[Legionary|Legionaries]] of the late [[Roman Republic|republic]] and early empire often carried two \'\'pila\'\', with one sometimes being lighter than the other. Standard tactics called for a Roman soldier to throw his \'\'pilum\'\' (both if there was time) at the enemy just before charging to engage with his \'\'[[gladius]]\'\'. Some \'\'pila\'\' had small hand-guards, to protect the wielder if he intended to use it as a melee weapon, but it does not appear that this was common.\n\n====Late Empire====\nIn the late Roman Empire, the Roman infantry came to use a differently-shaped javelin from the earlier [[pilum]]. This javelin was lighter and had a greater range. Called a [[plumbata]], it resembled a thick stocky arrow, fletched with leather vanes to provide stability and rotation in flight (which increased accuracy). To overcome its comparatively small mass, the plumbata was fitted with an oval-shaped lead weight socketed around the shaft just forward of the [[Center of mass|center of balance]], giving the weapon its name. Even so, plumbatae were much lighter than pila, and would not have had the armour penetration or shield transfixing capabilities of their earlier counterparts.\n\nTwo or three plumbatae were typically clipped to a small wooden bracket on the inside of the large oval or round shields used at the time. Massed troops would unclip and hurl plumbatae as the enemy neared, hopefully stalling their movement and morale by making them clump together and huddle under their shields. With the enemy deprived of rapid movement and their visibility impaired by their own raised shields, the Roman troops were then better placed to exploit the tactical situation. It is unlikely plumbatae were viewed by the Romans as the killing blow, but more as a means of stalling the enemy at ranges greater than previously provided by the heavier and shorter ranged pilum.\n\n===Gaul===\nThe Gallic cavalry used to hurl several javelin volleys to soften the enemy before a frontal attack. The Gallic cavalry used their javelins in a tactic similar to that of [[horse archer]]s\' [[Parthian shot]]. The Gauls knew how to turn on horseback to throw javelins backwards while appearing to retreat.\n\n===Iberia===\nThe Hispanic cavalry was a light cavalry armed with \'\'[[falcata]]s\'\' and several light javelins. The [[Cantabri]] tribes invented a military tactic to maximize the advantages of the combination between horse and javelin. In this tactic the horsemen rode around in circles, toward and away from the enemy, continually hurling javelins. The tactic was usually employed against heavy infantry. The constant movement of the horsemen gave them an advantage against slow infantry and made them hard to target. The maneuver was designed to harass and taunt the enemy forces, disrupting close formations. This was commonly used against enemy infantry, especially the heavily armed and slow moving legions of the Romans. This tactic came to be known as the [[Cantabrian circle]]. In the late Republic various auxiliary cavalry completely replaced the Italian cavalry contingents and the Hispanic auxiliary cavalry was considered the best.\n\n===Numidia===\nThe [[Numidians]] were indigenous tribes of [[northwest Africa]]. The [[Numidian cavalry]] was a light cavalry usually operating as skirmishers. The Numidian horseman was armed with a small shield and several javelins. The Numidians had a reputation as swift horsemen, cunning soldiers and excellent javelin throwers. It is said that [[Jugurtha]], the Numidian king "...took part in the national pursuits of riding, [[javelin throw]]ing and competed with other young men in running." [Sallust The Jugurthine War: 6]. The Numidian Cavalry served as mercenaries in the [[Carthaginian Army]] and played a key role in assisting both [[Hannibal]] and Scipio during the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Middle ages==\n[[Image:Bayeux Tapestry 4.jpg|right|thumb|470px|Norman cavalry armed with lances attacks the Anglo-Saxon shield wall.

In the flag of [[Eswatini]] there is a shield and two javelins, which symbolize the protection from the country\'s enemies.\n\n====Zulu====\nThe [[Zulu people|Zulu]] warriors used a long version of the [[assegai]] javelin as their primary weapon. The Zulu legendary leader [[Shaka]] initiated [[Shaka#Social and military revolution|military reforms]] in which a short stabbing spear, with a long, swordlike spearhead named [[iklwa]], had become the Zulu warrior\'s main weapon and was used as a [[mêlée weapon]]. The assegai was not discarded, but was used for an initial missile assault. With the larger shields, introduced by Shaka to the Zulu army, the short spears used as stabbing swords and the opening phase of javelin attack; the Zulu regiments were quite similar to the Roman legion with its [[Scutum (shield)|Scutum]], [[Gladius]] and Pilum tactical combination.\n\n==Mythology==\n===Norse mythology===\n\nIn Norse mythology, Odin, the chief god, carried a javelin or spear called Gungnir.
