[[Agate]] and onyx are both varieties of layered chalcedony that differ only in the form of the bands: agate has curved bands and onyx has parallel bands. The colors of its bands range from black to almost every color. Commonly, specimens of onyx contain bands of black and/or white.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2999.html |title=Onyx |last=Lavinsky |first=Rob |publisher=mindat.org |access-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref> Onyx, as a descriptive term, has also been applied to parallel banded varieties of alabaster, marble, calcite, obsidian and opal, and misleadingly to materials with contorted banding, such as "Cave Onyx" and "Mexican Onyx".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2999.html |title=Onyx |last=Lavinsky |first=Rob |publisher=mindat.org |access-date=October 27, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Manutchehr-Danai |first=Mohsen |year=2013 |title=Dictionary of Gems and Gemology |location=New York |publisher=Springer |pages=340–341 |isbn=9783662042885}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Schumann |first=Walter |year=2009 |title=Gemstones of the World |location=New York |publisher=Sterling |page=158 |isbn=9781402768293}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\'\'Onyx\'\' comes through Latin (of the same spelling), from the Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|ὄνυξ}}, meaning "claw" or "fingernail".

It is [[cryptocrystalline]], consisting of fine intergrowths of the [[silica]] minerals [[quartz]] and [[moganite]]. Its bands are parallel to one another, as opposed to the more chaotic banding that often occurs in agates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Assaad|first1=Fakhry A.|last2=LaMoreaux|first2=Philip E.

Black onyx is perhaps the most famous variety, but is not as common as onyx with colored bands. Artificial treatments have been used since ancient times to produce both the black color in "black onyx" and the reds and yellows in sardonyx. Most "black onyx" on the market is artificially colored.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sinkankas|first=John|title=Gemstones of North America|year=1959|publisher=Van Nostrand|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=316|volume = 1}}</ref><ref name="SA July 1874">{{cite journal|title=The Manufacture of Gem Stones|journal=Scientific American|date=25 July 1874|page=49|publisher=Munn & Company|location=New York, New York}}</ref>\n\n==Imitations and treatments==\nThe name has also commonly been used to label other banded materials, such as banded [[calcite]] found in  [[Mexico]], [[India]], and other places, and often carved, polished and sold.
