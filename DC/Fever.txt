The setpoint temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the [[preoptic area]] (POA) through the [[prostaglandin E receptor 3]] (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the [[dorsomedial hypothalamus]] (DMH), the rostral [[raphe]] pallidus nucleus in the [[medulla oblongata]] (rRPa), and the [[paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface.
