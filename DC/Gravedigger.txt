Digging graves has also been one of the traditional duties of a church\'s [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In municipal and privately owned cemeteries, gravediggers may be low-paid, unskilled and temporary labourers, or they may be well-paid, trained and professional careerists, as their duties may include [[landscaping]] tasks and courteous interactions with mourners and other visitors. In some countries, gravedigging may be done by landscaping workers for the local council or [[local authority]].\n\nA gravedigger implements a variety of tools to accomplish his primary task. A template, in the form of a wooden frame built to prescribed specifications, is often placed on the ground over the intended grave. The gravedigger may use a sod-cutter or [[spade]] to cut the outline of the grave and remove the top layer of [[sod]]. Digging the grave by hand usually requires [[shovel]]s, [[pickaxe|picks]], [[mattock]]s and/or other tools. Cemeteries in industrialized countries may keep a [[backhoe loader]] and other heavy equipment, which greatly increases the efficiency of gravedigging.\n\nTypically, gravediggers - at least in most Western countries - will use a wooden box to put the soil in. This box consists of several large pieces of wood that fit together, and the box is assembled next to the grave. Once the grave has been dug and the soil from the grave has been placed in the box, the box will usually be covered with a piece of [[tarpaulin]] or similar material. The soil will then remain in the box until the day of the back-fill, when the funeral takes place and the soil is emptied back into the grave after the [[coffin]] has been lowered, after which the box is disassembled. Due to the close proximity of graves in cemeteries (4 feet (1.20 m) between the centre of each [[headstone]] is common in modern UK cemeteries), the wooden box is often placed in front of one or more other graves, and is seen as a nuisance to those wishing to visit graves adjacent to a grave that is due to be filled.\n\nAlthough the expression "six feet under" refers to the depth at which people were traditionally buried, at least in the UK, the minimum legal depth for a new grave is seven feet (2.10 m).{{cn|date=September 2021}} This allows a maximum of three coffins to be buried in the same grave, typically family members of the deceased who are buried at a later date - which is known as a re-open. Gravediggers must take care to get the proportions of a grave right, as the hole needs to be big enough for the coffin to be lowered in. Additionally, [[shoring]] is often used to stop a grave from collapsing. Gravediggers must make sure that the coffin can fit through the shoring. Additionally, on the day of the back-fill and for the funeral service, typically [[artificial turf]] will be placed around the grave whilst the coffin is being lowered.\n\nIn many cultures throughout history, gravediggers have been highly marginalized by their societies. In the traditional caste system of [[India]], cemetery work has been the responsibility of the lowest castes, considered "unclean" or "untouchable" for their association with death.\n\n==Fossors==\n[[File:Gravedigger\'s template - geograph.org.uk - 1184113.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grave template, topped with the handle of a [[scythe]]. Church of St. Michael, [[Garway]], [[England]].]]\n[[Image:Evstafiev-bosnia-sarajevo-grave-digger-shovels.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Gravedigger with shovels, [[Sarajevo]]]]\n\n\'\'\'Fossor\'\'\' (Latin \'\'\'\'\'fossorius\'\'\'\'\', from the verb \'\'fodere\'\' \'to dig\') is a term described in Chambers\' dictionary as archaic, but can conveniently be revived to describe grave diggers in the Roman [[catacombs]] in the first three centuries of the [[Christian Era]]. The duties of the Christian fossor corresponded in a general way with those of the pagan \'\'vespillones\'\', but whereas the latter were held in anything but esteem in pagan society (many religions consider corpses, and sometimes anyone who touches them, \'unclean\' also in a religious sense), the fossors from an early date were ranked among the inferior [[clergy]] of the Church (Wieland, Ordines Minores, 1897).\n\nIn the \'\'Gesta apud Zenophilum\'\' by [[St. Optatus of Mileve]], a reference is made to the character of the fossors as an order of inferior clergy. Speaking of the "house in which Christians assembled" at [[Cirta]] in the year 303, during the [[persecution of Diocletian]], this writer enumerates first the higher orders of the clergy present, from the [[bishop]] to the [[subdeacon]]s, and then mentions by name the fossors Januarius, Heraclius, Fructuosus, \'\'et ceteris fossoribus\'\'.<ref>"Opp. S. Optati", ed. C. Ziwsa, in "Corpus Script. Eccl. Lat.", Vienna, 1893, XXVI, 187.</ref> [[St. Jerome]]<ref>Also (Ep. xlix)</ref> alludes to fossors as \'\'clerici\'\', and a sixth-century chronicle edited by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Mai<ref>(Spicil. Rom., IX, 133)</ref> enumerates the (minor) orders of the clergy as \'\'[[ostiarius]]\'\', \'\'[[fossorius]]\'\', \'\'[[lector]]\'\', etc. At first the fossors seem to have received no regular salary, but were paid by individuals for the work accomplished; with the organization of the Church, however, they appear to have been paid from the common treasury. In the fourth century the corporation of fossors was empowered to sell burial spaces. For example, in the cemetery of [[St. Cyriacus]], two women bought from the fossor Quintus a \'\'bisomus\'\', or double grave, \'\'retro sanctos\'\' (behind and near a martyr\'s tomb), and there are several other references to this practice.\n\nThe corporation of fossors probably did not consist merely of the labourers who excavated the galleries of the catacombs; it also included the artists who decorated the tombs, as appears from another allusion in the \'\'Gesta apud Zenophilum\'\' already cited. According to this authority two fossors were brought before the judge;<ref>(\'\'inductis et adplicitis Victore Samsurici et Saturnino fossoribus\'\')</ref> when interrogated as to their calling, one replied that he was a fossor, the other that he was an \'\'artifex\'\', meaning a painter or sculptor.catacomb\n\nAmong the representations of fossors in the catacombs the one best known, through Wiseman\'s "Fabiola", is that of the fossor Diogenes, discovered by Boldetti. The picture, which was seriously damaged in an attempt to remove it from the wall, represents Diogenes with his pick over his right shoulder and a sack, probably containing his midday meal, on his left shoulder, while in his left hand he carries a staff with a light attached. The inscription reads: \'\'DIOGENES FOSSOR, IN PACE DEPOSITVS, OCTABV KALENDAS OCTOBRIS\'\' ("the fossor Diogenes, interred in peace, the eighth day before the calends of October"). The oldest [[fresco]] of a fossor, or rather of two fossors, dates from the late second century, is in one of the [[Sacrament]] Chapels in the catacomb of [[St. Callistus]]. The figures are represented pointing toward three [[Eucharist]]ic scenes, a reference to another of their duties, which was to exclude unauthorized persons from taking part in the liturgical celebrations held occasionally in the cemeteries in commemoration of [[martyr]]s. Representations of fossors are usually near the entrance of the subterranean cemeteries.\n\n==Notable gravediggers==\n* [[Abraham Lincoln]], later President of the United States, worked as a sexton in a churchyard in Spencer County, Indiana, {{ref|GRV}}\n* [[List of blues musicians|Blues musician]] [[James Son Thomas|James "Sonny Ford" Thomas]] worked as a gravedigger during his youth in [[Mississippi]].<ref>\'\'Encyclopædia Britannica Book of the Year\'\' article on James "Sonny Ford" Thomas, Online 15 October 2005</ref>\n* Blues musician [[John Jackson (musician)|John Jackson]] worked as a gravedigger in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]].<ref>"John Jackson." \'\'Contemporary Black Biography, Volume 36.\'\' Edited by Ashyia Henderson.

While he was temporarily employed by the cemetery in his youth, his work consisted of marking plots and performing various other manual tasks, which did not include gravedigging.

Perhaps the most famous of these occurs during Act 5, Scene 1 of [[Shakespeare]]\'s \'\'[[Hamlet]]\'\', where Hamlet and [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]] engage in dialogue with one of the grave-makers (called "First Clown") as he is digging [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]]\'s grave. The Gravediggers (or Clowns) make their one and only appearance at the beginning of the act. They enter and begin digging a grave for the newly deceased Ophelia, discussing whether or not she deserves a Christian burial after having killed herself.\n\nWhen together, the Gravediggers speak mainly in riddles and witty banter regarding death, with the first asking the questions and the second answering.\n\n{{quote|\'\'\'GRAVEDIGGER\'\'\': What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?<br>\n\'\'\'OTHER\'\'\': The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.|V.i., 38–41}}\n\nand later in the scene:\n\n{{quote|\'\'\'GRAVEDIGGER\'\'\': And when you are asked this question next, say "A grave-maker". The houses that he makes last till doomsday.|V.i., 53–55}}\n\nSoon, Hamlet enters and engages in a quick dialog with the first Gravedigger. The scene ends with Hamlet\'s soliloquies regarding the circle of life prompted by his discovery of the skull of his beloved jester, [[Yorick]]. The First Clown unearths Yorick\'s skull, prompting Hamlet to deliver the memorable lines: "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy".<ref>[http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/hamlet/60.html Cliffs Notes summary of Act 5, Scene 1 in \'\'Hamlet\'\'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211005553/http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/hamlet/60.html |date=11 December 2005 }}</ref>\n\n==Marxism==\n\nIn the terminology of [[Marxism]], a rising revolutionary class which is destined to overthrow and supplant an earlier ruling class is often referred to as that earlier class\' "gravedigger". Thus, the [[bourgeoisie]]\'s historical role was to act as "the gravedigger of [[feudalism]]", but by creating a vast exploited [[working class]] which is bound to organize and stage a revolution, the bourgeoisie has inevitably created its own "gravedigger".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aworldtowin.net/resources/communistmanifesto.html |title=Resources &#124; Ideas &#124; The significance of the Communist Manifesto |publisher=A World to Win |access-date=2011-12-24}}</ref>\n\nThis metaphorical use of \'\'gravedigger\'\' is already attested in [[Karl Marx]]\'s own writings, and was continued in the same sense by [[Lenin]], [[Stalin]], [[Trotsky]] and many other Marxist theoreticians and leaders.\n\n==Low social status==\nIn several societies worldwide, gravediggers are often drawn from the lowest [[social class]] or [[caste]], and regarded as [[wikt:Special:Search/unclean|unclean]]. In India, gravediggers and related professions have traditionally been drawn from among the [[Dalit|Untouchables]]. In feudal [[Japan]], gravedigging was one of the "unclean" professions historically allotted to the [[Burakumin]] class. Other examples can be found in [[Ancient Egypt]] and elsewhere.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|gravedigger}}\n*[[Chevra kadisha]] ([[Jew]]ish grave diggers)\n*[[Grave robbery]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{note|GRV}} As shown on a sign posted at that cemetery, see [http://graveyards.com/graveyard/?id=11538 graveyards.com] (photo 10 of 10)\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Gravediggers}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Catholic|wstitle=Fossors}}\n\n{{note|World.Eras}}"The Pappenheimer Family." \'\'World Eras, Vol. 1: European Renaissance and Reformation (1350–1600)\'\'.
