In 366 BC, the \'\'[[Ludi Romani]]\'\' became the first games to be placed on the [[Fasti|religious calendar]] as an annual event sponsored by the [[Roman State|state]] as a whole.<ref>Alison Futrell, \'\'The Roman Games: A Sourcebook\'\' (Blackwell, 2006), p. 2.</ref> Games in the circus were preceded by a parade \'\'([[pompa circensis]])\'\' featuring the competitors, mounted youths of the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]], armed dancers, musicians, a [[satyr]] chorus, and images of [[List of Roman deities|the gods]]. As the product of military victory, \'\'ludi\'\' were often connected to [[Roman triumph|triumphs]]. The first recorded \'\'[[venatio]]\'\' (staged beast hunt) was presented in 186 BC by [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|M.

Although public money was allocated for the staging of \'\'ludi\'\', the presiding official increasingly came to augment the splendor of his games from personal funds as a form of [[public relations]].<ref>Lovat, \'\'Statius and Epic Games\'\', p. 10.</ref> The sponsor was able to advertise his wealth, while declaring that he intended to share it for public benefit. Although some men with an eye on the consulship skipped the office of aedile for the very reason that massive expenditures were expected, those with sufficient resources spent lavishly to cultivate the favor of the people. The religious festivals to which the \'\'ludi\'\' were attached also occasioned public banquets, and often public works such as the refurbishing or building of temples.<ref>Overview based on Sumi, \'\'Ceremony and Power\'\' (see below).

Caesar\'s heir [[Octavian]] at once upstaged him with \'\'[[Ludi Victoriae Caesaris]]\'\', "games in honor of Caesar\'s victory," which ran July 20–28 in conjunction with a festival to honor [[Venus (mythology)#Epithets|Venus Genetrix]], Caesar\'s patron deity and divine matriarch of the [[gens Iulia|Julian \'\'gens\'\']]. It was during these \'\'ludi\'\', which also served as funeral games, that the comet famously appeared to "announce" [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#End of the Republic|Caesar\'s newly divine status]]. Octavian recognized the value of the festivals in unifying the people, and as [[Augustus]] instituted new \'\'ludi\'\' within his program of religious reform; public spectacles and entertainments were thus subsumed by [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].<ref>Geoffrey S.
