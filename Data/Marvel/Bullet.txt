The artillery [[cannon]] appeared in 1326 and the European [[hand cannon]] in 1364. Early projectiles were made of stone. Eventually it was discovered that stone would not penetrate stone fortifications, which led to the use of denser materials as projectiles. Hand cannon projectiles developed in a similar manner. The first recorded instance of a metal ball from a hand cannon penetrating armor was in 1425.<ref>{{cite web|title=Important Dates in Gun History|url=http://armscollectors.com/gunhistorydates.htm|website=armscollectors.com|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref>  Shot retrieved from the wreck of the \'\'[[Mary Rose]]\'\' (sunk in 1545, raised in 1982) are of different sizes, and some are stone while others are cast iron.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Cannon from the Mary Rose|url=http://www.teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/a_cannon_from_the_mary_rose|website=teachinghistory100.com|publisher=The British Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe development of the hand [[culverin]] and [[matchlock]] [[arquebus]] brought about the use of [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] lead balls as projectiles. The original round [[musket]] ball was smaller than the bore of the barrel. At first it was loaded into the barrel just resting upon the powder. Later, some sort of material was used as a [[wadding]] between the ball and the powder as well as over the ball to keep it in place,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trackofthewolf.com/list/Item.aspx/163/1|title=Precision Shooting Patches for round ball – Track of the Wolf|website=www.trackofthewolf.com}}</ref> it held the bullet firmly in the barrel and against the powder. (Bullets not firmly set on the powder risked exploding the barrel, with the condition known as a "short start".)<ref>{{cite web|title=How to load a musket|url=https://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/1836/the_battle/the_weapons/load.html|website=tamu.edu|publisher=The Second Flying Company of Alamo de Parras|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe loading of muskets was therefore easy with the old smooth-bore [[Brown Bess]] and similar military muskets. The original muzzle-loading [[rifle]], however, was loaded with a piece of leather or cloth wrapped around the ball, to allow the ball to engage the grooves in the barrel.  Loading was a bit more difficult, particularly when the bore of the barrel was fouled from previous firings. For this reason, and because rifles were not often fitted for [[Bayonet|bayonets]], early rifles were rarely used for military purposes, compared to muskets.\n\n[[File:Naseby musket balls.jpg|thumb|[[Matchlock]] [[musket balls]], alleged to have been discovered on the battlefield of [[Battle of Naseby|Naseby]] (1645)]]There was a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet during the first half of the 19th century. In 1826, [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne]], a French [[infantry]] officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the [[rifling]] grooves. Delvigne\'s method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate. In 1855 a detachment of [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st U.S. Dragoons]], while on patrol, traded lead for gold bullets with [[Pima people|Pima Indians]] along the California–Arizona border. "The use of gold bullets by Indians is confirmed by Aubry in a journey across central Arizona.  \'\'"The Indians use gold bullets for their guns.  They are of different sizes and each Indian has a pouch of them.

The most notable use of square bullet designs was by [[James Puckle]] and Kyle Tunis who patented them, where they were briefly used in one version of the [[Puckle gun]]. The early use of these in the [[Gunpowder|black-powder]] era was soon discontinued because of the irregular and unpredictable flight patterns.\n\n===Pointed bullets===\n[[File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg#/media/File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henri-Gustave Delvigne|Delvigne]] further developed cylindro-spherical (left) and cylindro-conical bullets (middle), which received the bullet grooves developed by [[François Tamisier|Tamisier]] for stability|link=File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg]]\n\nDelvigne continued to develop bullet design and by 1830 had started to develop cylindro-conical bullets.

It was another improvement of the work done by Delvigne. The bullet was conical in shape with a hollow cavity in the rear, which was fitted with a small iron cap instead of a wooden plug. When fired, the iron cap forced itself into the hollow cavity at the rear of the bullet, thus expanding the sides of the bullet to grip and engage the rifling. In 1851, the British adopted the Minié ball for their [[British military rifles|702-inch Pattern 1851 Minié rifle]]. In 1855, James Burton, a machinist at the U.S. Armory at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper\'s Ferry, West Virginia]], improved the Minié ball further by eliminating the metal cup in the bottom of the bullet.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Park Service Museum Collections|url=http://npscollections.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-drawings-of-james-burton-machinist.html|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Rare and Endangered Artifacts|url=https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/top-10-rare-and-endangered-artifacts.htm|website=nps.gov|publisher=nps.gov|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref> The Minié ball first saw widespread use in the [[Crimean War]] (1853-1856).

The Whitworth bullet was made to fit the grooves of the rifle mechanically. The Whitworth rifle was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866. In 1861 W.B. Chace approached President [[Abraham Lincoln]] with an improved ball design for muskets. In firing over the [[Potomac River]] where the Chace ball and the round ball were alternated, Lincoln observed that the Chace design carried a third or more farther fired at the same elevation. Although Lincoln recommended testing, it never took place.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bilby|first1=Joe|title=Pedersoli musket, Nessler Balls and RCBS Dies|url=http://www.civilwarguns.com/9910b.html|access-date=29 January 2017|publisher=civilwarguns.com|date=1999|archive-date=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204419/http://www.civilwarguns.com/9910b.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAround 1862, [[William Ellis Metford|W.

The combined result was that, in December 1888, the [[Lee–Metford]] small-bore ([[.303 British|.303]]", 7.70&nbsp;mm) rifle, Mark I, was adopted for the British army. The Lee–Metford was the predecessor of the [[Lee–Enfield]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lee Metford (Magazine Lee Metford / MLM) Bolt-Action Service Rifle (1888)|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=533|website=militaryfactory.com|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Modern bullets===\n[[File:Bullet types on .270 ammunition.jpg|left|thumb|[[.270 Winchester]] ammunition:{{Ordered list |list_style_type=decimal  |{{convert|100|gr|adj=on}} – [[hollow-point bullet|hollow point]] |{{convert|115|gr|adj=on}} – [[Full metal jacket (ammunition)|FMJBT]]|{{convert|130|gr|adj=on}} – [[soft point]] |{{convert|150|gr|adj=on}} – round nose }}]]\nThe next important change in the history of the rifle bullet occurred in 1882, when Lieutenant Colonel [[Eduard Rubin]], director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented the [[Full metal jacket (ammunition)|copper-jacketed bullet]] — an elongated bullet with a lead core in a copper jacket. It was also small bore (7.5mm and 8mm) and it is the precursor of the 8mm \'\'Lebel bullet\'\' adopted for the [[smokeless powder]] ammunition of the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle]]. The surface of lead bullets fired at high velocity may melt from the hot gases behind and friction within the bore. Because copper has a higher [[melting point]], and greater [[specific heat capacity]], and higher [[hardness]], copper-jacketed bullets allow greater muzzle velocities.\n\n[[Image:.303ammunition.jpeg|thumb|[[.303 British|.303 inch]] (7.7 mm) centrefire, [[Full metal jacket bullet|FMJ]] rimmed ammunition|180x180px]]European advances in aerodynamics led to the pointed [[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullet]]. By the beginning of the 20th century, most world armies had begun the transition to spitzer bullets. These bullets flew for greater distances more accurately and transferred more [[kinetic energy]]. Spitzer bullets combined with [[machine gun]]s greatly increased lethality on the battlefield. \n\nSpitzer bullets were streamlined at the base with the [[External ballistics#General trends in drag or ballistic coefficient|boat tail]]. In the trajectory of a bullet, as air passes over a bullet at high speed, a vacuum is created at the end of the bullet, slowing the projectile. The streamlined boat tail design reduces this [[Parasitic drag|form drag]] by allowing the air to flow along the surface of the tapering end. The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as the optimum shape for rifle technology. The first combination spitzer and boat-tail bullet, named \'\'balle\'\' D by its inventor Captain Georges Desaleux, was introduced as standard military ammunition in 1901, for the French [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle]].\n\nA [[Plastic-tipped bullet|ballistic tip]] bullet is a [[Hollow-point bullet|hollow-point]] rifle bullet that has a plastic tip on the end of the bullet. This improves [[external ballistics]] by streamlining the bullet, allowing it to cut through the air more easily, and improves [[terminal ballistics]] by allowing the bullet to act as a jacketed hollow point. As a side effect, it also feeds better in weapons that have trouble feeding rounds that are not full metal jacket rounds.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Design==\n\n[[Image:Bullet coming from S&W.jpg|thumb|A bullet in mid flight]][[File:Bullet exit wound of a lung shot Dama dama Sweden 01.png|thumb|[[Gunshot wound|Bullet wound]] on the ribs of a deer in the lung area ]]Bullet designs have to solve two primary problems. In the barrel, they must first form a seal with the gun\'s bore. If a strong seal is not achieved, gas from the propellant charge leaks past the bullet, thus reducing efficiency and possibly accuracy. The bullet must also engage the rifling without damaging or excessively fouling the gun\'s bore and without distorting the bullet, which will also reduce accuracy. Bullets must have a surface that forms this seal without excessive friction. These interactions between bullet and bore are termed [[internal ballistics]]. Bullets must be produced to a high standard, as surface imperfections can affect firing accuracy.\n\nThe physics affecting the bullet once it leaves the barrel is termed [[external ballistics]]. The primary factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet\'s shape and the rotation imparted by the rifling of the gun barrel. Rotational forces stabilize the bullet gyroscopically as well as aerodynamically. Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins. However, a spin rate greater than the optimum value adds more trouble than good, by magnifying the smaller asymmetries or sometimes resulting in the bullet breaking apart in flight. With smooth-bore firearms, a spherical shape is optimal because no matter how the bullet is oriented, its aerodynamics are similar. These unstable bullets tumble erratically and provide only moderate accuracy; however, the aerodynamic shape changed little for centuries. Generally, bullet shapes are a compromise between aerodynamics, interior ballistic necessities, and [[terminal ballistics]] requirements. \n\nTerminal ballistics and [[stopping power]] are aspects of bullet design that affect what happens when a bullet impacts with an object. The outcome of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the [[Angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]], and the velocity and physical characteristics of the bullet. Bullets are generally designed to penetrate, deform, or break apart. For a given material and bullet, the strike velocity is the primary factor that determines which outcome is achieved.\n\nBullet shapes are many and varied. With a mold, bullets can be made at home for reloading ammunition, where local laws allow. Hand-casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead bullets. Cast and jacketed bullets are also commercially available from numerous manufacturers for [[handloading]] and are most often more convenient than casting bullets from bulk or scrap lead.\n\n==Propulsion==\n\nPropulsion of the ball can happen via several methods:\n* by using only gunpowder (as in [[flintlock]] weapons)\n* by using a [[percussion cap]] and gunpowder (as in percussion weapons)\n* by using a [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]\n\n==Materials==\n[[Image:Halvmantlad.jpg|thumb|[[Expanding bullet]] loaded in a [[6.5×55mm]] before and after expanding. The long base and small expanded diameter show that this is a bullet designed for deep penetration on [[large game]]. The bullet in the photo traveled more than halfway through a moose before coming to rest, performing as designed.]]\n\nBullets for black powder, or muzzle-loading firearms, were classically molded from pure [[lead]]. This worked well for low-speed bullets, fired at velocities of less than 450&nbsp;m/s (1,475&nbsp;ft/s). For slightly higher-speed bullets fired in modern firearms, a harder [[alloy]] of lead and tin or typesetter\'s lead (used to mold [[Linotype (alloy)|linotype]]) works very well. For even higher-speed bullet use, jacketed lead bullets are used. The common element in all of these, lead, is widely used because it is very dense, thereby providing a high amount of mass—and thus, kinetic energy—for a given volume. Lead is also cheap, easy to obtain, easy to work, and melts at a low temperature, which results in comparatively easy fabrication of bullets.\n\n* \'\'\'Lead\'\'\': simple [[Cast bullet|cast]], extruded, [[swaging|swaged]], or otherwise fabricated lead [[Slug (disambiguation)|slugs]] are the simplest form of bullets. At speeds of greater than 300 [[Meter per second|m/s]] (1,000&nbsp;ft/s) (common in most [[Handgun|handguns]]), lead is deposited in rifled bores at an ever-increasing rate. Alloying the lead with a small percentage of [[tin]] and/or [[antimony]] serves to reduce this effect but grows less effective as velocities are increased. A cup made of harder metal, such as copper, placed at the base of the bullet and called a [[gas check]], is often used to decrease lead deposits by protecting the rear of the bullet against melting when fired at higher pressures, but this does not solve the problem at higher velocities. A modern solution is to [[Powder coating|powder coat]] the lead projectile, encasing it in a protective skin, allowing higher velocities to be achieved without lead deposits.\n* \'\'\'Jacketed lead\'\'\': bullets intended for even higher-velocity applications generally have a lead core that is jacketed or plated with [[gilding metal]], [[cupronickel]], [[copper]] alloys, or [[steel]]; a thin layer of harder metal protects the softer lead core when the bullet is passing through the barrel and during flight, which allows delivering the bullet intact to the target. There, the heavy lead core delivers its kinetic energy to the target. Full metal jacket or "ball" bullets (cartridges with ball bullets, which despite the name are not spherical, are called ball ammunition) are completely encased in the harder metal jacket, except for the base. Some bullet jackets do not extend to the front of the bullet, to aid expansion and increase lethality; these are called soft point (if the exposed lead tip is solid) or hollow point bullets (if a cavity or hole is present). Steel bullets are often plated with copper or other metals for corrosion resistance during long periods of storage. Synthetic jacket materials such as [[nylon]] and [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] have been used, with limited success, especially in rifles; however, hollow point bullets with plastic aerodynamic tips have been very successful at both improving accuracy and enhancing expansion. Newer plastic coatings for handgun bullets, such as [[Teflon-coated bullet]]s, are making their way into the market.\n[[File:3CastBullets.png|thumb|Hard cast solid bullet (left), with gas check (center) and lubrication (right)]]\n[[File:Cartridge cross section.svg|thumb|A modern [[centerfire]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|\'\'cartridge\'\']] consisting of the following:\n\n\'\'1.\'\' \'\'bullet\'\',  as the [[projectile]]; \'\'2.\'\' \'\'metallic\'\' [[Cartridge (firearms)|\'\'case\'\']], which holds all parts together; \n\n\'\'3.\'\' \'\'propellant\'\', for example [[gunpowder]] or [[cordite]];\'\'4.\'\' \'\'rim\'\', which provides the extractor on the firearm a place to grip the case to remove it from the chamber once fired; \n\n\'\'5.\'\' [[Primer (firearms)|\'\'primer\'\']], which ignites the propellant.]]\n* \'\'\'Solid\'\'\' or \'\'[[Monolithic bullet|monolithic solid]]\'\': mono-metal bullets intended for deep penetration in big game animals and slender shaped very-low-drag projectiles for long range shooting are produced out of metals like oxygen-free copper and alloys like [[cupronickel]], [[tellurium copper]] and [[brass]] (e.g., highly machinable UNS C36000 free-cutting brass). Often these projectiles are turned on precision [[Lathe (metal)#CNC lathe / CNC turning center|CNC lathes]]. In the case of solids, and the ruggedness of the game animals on which they are used, e.g., the African buffalo or elephant, expansion is almost entirely relinquished for the necessary penetration. In shotgunning, "slug" loads are often solid large single lead projectiles, sometimes with a hollow point, used for deer or wild pig hunting in jurisdictions that do not allow hunting with rifles (because a missed slug shot will travel considerably less far than a rifle bullet).\n**\'\'\'Fluted\'\'\': in appearance, these are solid bullets with scalloped sides (missing material). The theory is that the flutes produce hydraulic jetting when passing through tissue, creating a wound channel larger than that made by conventional [[Expanding bullet|expanding ammunition]] such as hollow point bullets.\n**\'\'\'Hard cast\'\'\': a hard lead alloy intended to reduce fouling of rifling grooves (especially of the [[polygonal rifling]] used in some popular pistols). Benefits include simpler manufacture than jacketed bullets and good performance against hard targets; limitations are an inability to [[Hollow-point bullet#Expansion|mushroom]] and subsequent over-penetration of soft targets.\n* \'\'\'[[Blank (cartridge)|Blank]]\'\'\': wax, paper, plastic, and other materials are used to simulate live gunfire and are intended only to hold the powder in a blank cartridge and to produce noise, flame and smoke. The "bullet" may be captured in a purpose-designed device or it may be allowed to expend what little energy it has in the air. Some blank cartridges are crimped or closed at the end and do not contain any bullet; some are fully loaded cartridges (without bullets) designed to propel rifle grenades. The force of the expanding gas from blank cartridges can be lethal at short range; numerous tragic accidents have occurred with blank cartridges (e.g., the death of actor [[Jon-Erik Hexum]]).\n* \'\'\'Practice\'\'\': made from lightweight materials like rubber, [[Wax bullet|wax]], wood, plastic, or lightweight metal, practice bullets are intended for short-range target work only. Because of their weight and low velocity, they have limited range.\n* \'\'\'Polymer\'\'\': these are metal-polymer composites, generally lighter and having higher velocities than pure metal bullets of the same dimensions. They permit unusual designs that are difficult with conventional casting or lathing.\n* \'\'\'Less lethal\'\'\', or \'\'less than lethal\'\': [[Rubber bullet]]s, [[plastic bullet]]s, and [[Bean bag round|beanbags]] are designed to be [[Non-lethal weapon|non-lethal]], e.g., for use in [[riot control]]. They are generally low velocity and are fired from shotguns, grenade launchers, paint ball guns, or specially designed firearms and air gun devices.\n* \'\'\'[[Incendiary ammunition|Incendiary]]\'\'\': these bullets are made with explosive or flammable mixtures in the tips that are designed to ignite on contact with a target. The intent is to ignite fuel or munitions in the target area, thereby adding to the destructive power of the bullet.\n* \'\'\'[[High-explosive incendiary/armor-piercing ammunition|Exploding]]\'\'\': similar to the incendiary bullet, this type of projectile is designed to explode upon hitting a hard surface, preferably the bone of the intended target. Not to be mistaken for cannon shells or grenades with fuse devices, these bullets have only cavities filled with a small amount of high explosive depending on the velocity and deformation upon impact to detonate. Exploding bullets have been used in various [[Heavy machine gun|heavy machine guns]] and in [[Anti-materiel rifle|anti-materiel rifles]].\n* \'\'\'[[Tracer ammunition|Tracer]]\'\'\': these have hollow backs, filled with a [[flare]] material. Usually this is a mixture of [[magnesium]], a [[perchlorate]], and [[strontium]] salts to yield a bright red color, although other materials providing other colors have also sometimes been used. Tracer material burns out after a certain amount of time. This allows the shooter to visually trace the flight path of the projectile and thus make necessary ballistic corrections, without having to confirm projectile impacts and without even using the [[Sight (device)|sights]] of the weapon. This type of round is also used by all branches of the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] in combat environments as a signaling device to friendly forces. Normally it is loaded at a four to one ratio with ball ammunition.\n* \'\'\'[[armor-piercing bullet|Armor-piercing]]\'\'\': jacketed designs where the core material is a very hard, high-density metal such as [[tungsten]], [[tungsten carbide]], [[depleted uranium]], or [[steel]]. A pointed tip is often used, but a flat tip on the penetrator portion is generally more effective.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hughes | first = David | title = The History and Development of the M16 Rifle and Its Cartridge | publisher = Armory Pub | location = Oceanside | year = 1990 | isbn = 978-0-9626096-0-2 }}</ref>\n* \'\'\'Nontoxic shot\'\'\': steel, [[bismuth]], tungsten, and other alloys prevent release of toxic lead into the environment. Regulations in several countries mandate the use of nontoxic projectiles especially when [[waterfowl hunting]]. It has been found that birds swallow small lead shot for their [[Gizzard|gizzards]] to grind food (as they would swallow pebbles of similar size), and the effects of [[Animal lead poisoning|lead poisoning]] by grinding of lead pellets against food means lead poisoning effects are magnified. Such concerns apply primarily to shotguns firing pellets ([[Shotgun shell|shot]]) and not bullets, but there is evidence suggesting that consumption of spent rifle and pistol ammunition is also hazardous to wildlife.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research—Eagles and Lead.|url=http://www.soarraptors.org/leadresearch.html|publisher=SOAR Raptor Foundation}}</ref> Reduction of hazardous substances legislation has also been applied to bullets on occasion to reduce the impact of lead on the environment at [[shooting range]]s. \n* \'\'\'[[Blended-metal bullets|Blended-metal]]\'\'\': bullets made using cores from powdered metals other than lead with binder or sometimes [[sintering|sintered]].\n* \'\'\'[[Frangible bullet|Frangible]]\'\'\': designed to disintegrate into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration for reasons of range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the shoot-through danger behind the intended target. An example is the [[Glaser Safety Slug]], usually a pistol caliber bullet made from an amalgam of lead shot and a hard (and thus frangible) plastic binder designed to penetrate a human target and release its component shot pellets without exiting the target.\n* \'\'\'[[Multiple projectile ammunition|Multiple projectile]]\'\'\': bullets that are made of separate slugs that fit together inside the cartridge and act as a single projectile inside the barrel as they are fired. The projectiles part in flight but are held in formation by tethers that keep the individual parts of the "bullet" from flying too far away from each other. The intention of such ammo is to increase hit chance by giving a shot-like spread to rifled slug firing guns, while maintaining a consistency in shot groupings. Multiple impact bullets may be less stable in flight than conventional solid bullets because of the added [[Drag (physics)|drag]] from the tether line holding the pieces in formation, and each projectile affects the flight of all the others. This may limit the benefit provided by the spread of each bullet at longer ranges.\n==Treaties and prohibitions==\nPoisonous bullets were a subject to an international agreement as early as the [[Strasbourg Agreement (1675)]]. The [[Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868]] prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400&nbsp;grams;<ref>{{cite web\n |title = Purposes and Basic Principles of the Law of War\n |first = William H.\n |last = Glover\n |url=http://williamhgloverjd.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/purposes-and-basic-principles-of-the-law-of-war/\n |access-date = 2010-07-28 }}</ref> it was reasoned that more deadly bullets would lead to less suffering.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scout.com/military/warrior/Article/9-Weapons-That-are-Banned-From-Modern-War-101453688|title=9 Weapons That are Banned From Modern War|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920075712/http://scout.com/military/warrior/Article/9-Weapons-That-are-Banned-From-Modern-War-101453688|archive-date=2017-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]] prohibits certain kinds of ammunition for use by uniformed military personnel against the uniformed military personnel of opposing forces.
