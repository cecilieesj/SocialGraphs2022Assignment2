Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The National Time Service Center (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.<ref>[http://www.time.ac.cn/jianjie/1.htm NTSC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001755/http://www.time.ac.cn/jianjie/1.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }} 国家授时中心简介</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Muslim Quarter Xi\'an China.jpg|thumb|Muslim Quarter in Xi\'an]]\nAs of 2010 Xi\'an has a population of 5.4 million.<ref name="xatj.gov.cn">{{cite web|url=http://www.xatj.gov.cn/ptl/def/def/index_923_6225_ci_trid_2005876.html |script-title=zh:西安市2015年国民经济和社会发展统计公报 |website=www.xatj.gov.cn/|access-date=2016-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604012728/http://www.xatj.gov.cn/ptl/def/def/index_923_6225_ci_trid_2005876.html |archive-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\nCompared to the census data from 2007, the population has increased by 1.4 million persons.<ref name="xianpop"/> The population is 51.66&nbsp;percent male and 48.34&nbsp;percent female.<ref name="xianpop"/> Among its districts, [[Yanta District|Yanta]] has the largest population, with around 1.08 million inhabitants.<ref name="xianpop">{{cite web |script-title=zh:西安人口 |trans-title=Xi\'an population |url=http://www.xa.gov.cn/cenweb/xagov/xazl/xazonglan.jsp?flag=3 |publisher=City of Xi\'an |language=zh-hansChinese |access-date=2007-05-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322151526/http://www.xa.gov.cn/cenweb/xagov/xazl/xazonglan.jsp?flag=3 |archive-date=2007-03-22 }}</ref>\n\nThe Xi\'an [[metropolitan area]] was estimated by the [[OECD]] (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, a population of 12.9 million,<ref name="oecd2015">{{cite book|doi=10.1787/9789264230040-en|title=OECD Urban Policy Reviews: China 2015, OECD READ edition|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/urban-rural-and-regional-development/oecd-urban-policy-reviews-china-2015_9789264230040-en#page39|publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]|page=37|website=OECD iLibrary|language=en|date=April 18, 2015|issn=2306-9341|isbn=9789264230033|series=OECD Urban Policy Reviews|access-date=December 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327210032/http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/urban-rural-and-regional-development/oecd-urban-policy-reviews-china-2015_9789264230040-en#page39|archive-date=March 27, 2017|url-status=live}}Linked from the OECD here [http://www.oecd.org/china/oecd-urban-policy-reviews-china-2015-9789264230040-en.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044027/http://www.oecd.org/china/oecd-urban-policy-reviews-china-2015-9789264230040-en.htm |date=December 9, 2017 }}</ref>  of which 5,740,000 is urban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf |title=World urban areas |access-date=November 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503021711/http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf |archive-date=May 3, 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n<!--\n{{HideH\n|FrameStyle   = margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:75%;\n|HeadStyle    = background-color:#1e6653;color:#ffffff\n|ContentStyle = background-color:#c0d9cf;padding:5px;text-align:center;\n|Breakdown of Xi\'an population by district and county (2010 census)\n}}\n-->\n{| class="wikitable sortable" style="margin:auto;"\n|+ Breakdown of Xi\'an population by district and county\n! scope="col" class="unsortable" rowspan=2 | Division\n!! scope="col" colspan=3 | Permanent residents<ref name="Xi\'an 2010 permanent">{{cite web|script-title=zh:西安市2010年第六次全国人口普查主要数据公报|url=http://epaper.xiancn.com/xawb/html/2011-05/25/content_37285.htm|publisher=Xi\'an Evening News ({{zh|s=西安晚报 |labels=no}})|access-date=2014-07-03|date=May 25, 2011|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220070842/http://epaper.xiancn.com/xawb/html/2011-05/25/content_37285.htm|archive-date=February 20, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n!! scope="col" rowspan=2 | [[Hukou system|Hukou]] residents<ref>People\'s Republic of China County-level Division Population Statistics ({{zh|s=《中华人民共和国全国分县市人口统计资料2010》|labels=no}}).</ref>\n|-\n!! scope="col" style="width:70px;"| Total\n!! scope="col" style="width:70px;"| Percentage\n!! scope="col" style="width:70px;"| Population density (persons/km<sup>2</sup>)\n|-  style="text-align:right; font-weight:bold;"\n! style="width:200px;"|\'\'\'Xi\'an City\'\'\'\n| style="width:100px;"|8,467,837 || style="width:100px;"|100 || style="width:100px;"|838.66 || style="width:100px;"|7,827,260\n|- style="text-align:right;"\n!
