The device consists of a tall, upright frame with a weighted and angled [[blade]] suspended at the top. The condemned person is secured with [[stocks]] at the bottom of the frame, positioning the neck directly below the blade. The blade is then released, swiftly and forcefully decapitating the victim with a single, clean pass so that the head falls into a basket or other receptacle below.\n\nThe guillotine is best known for its use in [[France]], particularly during the [[French Revolution]], where the revolution\'s supporters celebrated it as the people\'s avenger and the revolution\'s opponents vilified it as the pre-eminent symbol of the violence of the [[Reign of Terror]].<ref>R.

Prior to the guillotine, France had used manual beheading alongside a variety of methods of execution, many of which were more gruesome and required a high level of precision and skill to carry out successfully.

An early example of the principle is found in the [[Perlesvaus|\'\'High History of the Holy Grail\'\']], dated to about 1210. Although the device is imaginary, its function is clear.<ref name="grail" /> The text says:\n\n{{quote|Within these three openings are the hallows set for them.

It is not known when the Halifax Gibbet was first used; the first recorded execution in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] dates from 1280, but that execution may have been by sword, axe, or gibbet. The machine remained in use until [[Oliver Cromwell]] forbade capital punishment for petty theft.\n\nA [[Hans Weiditz]] (1495-1537) woodcut illustration from the 1532 edition of [[Petrarch]]\'s \'\'De remediis utriusque fortunae\'\', or "Remedies for Both Good and Bad Fortune" shows a device similar to the Halifax Gibbet in the background being used for an execution.\n\n[[Holinshed\'s Chronicles]] of 1577 included a picture of "The execution of Murcod Ballagh near Merton in [[Ireland]] in 1307" showing a similar execution machine, suggesting its early use in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.guillotine.dk/Pages/History.html History of the guillotine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906164403/http://www.guillotine.dk/pages/history.html |date=6 September 2015 }}, The Guillotine Headquarters 2014.</ref>\n\nThe [[Maiden (guillotine)|Maiden]] was constructed in 1564 for the Provost and Magistrates of [[Edinburgh]], and was in use from April 1565 to 1710.

However, it was later named after French [[physician]] and [[Freemason]] [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], who proposed on 10 October 1789 the use of a special device to carry out executions in France in a more humane manner. A death penalty opponent, he was displeased with the [[breaking wheel]] and other common, more grisly methods of execution and sought to persuade [[Louis XVI of France]] to implement a less painful alternative. While not the device\'s inventor, Guillotin\'s name ultimately became an eponym for it. Contrary to popular myth, Guillotin did not die by guillotine but rather by natural causes.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=June 5, 2020 |title=Origins of the Guillotine |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/head-man/ |website=Snopes.com}}</ref>\n\n==== Invention ====\nFrench surgeon and physiologist [[Antoine Louis]], together with German engineer {{ill|Tobias Schmidt|de|Tobias Schmidt (Klavierbauer)}}, built a prototype for the guillotine.

All citizens condemned to die were from then on executed there, until the scaffold was moved on 21 August to the [[Place du Carrousel]].\n\nThe machine was deemed successful because it was considered a humane form of execution in contrast with the more cruel methods used in the pre-revolutionary \'\'[[Ancien Régime]]\'\'. In France, before the invention of the guillotine, members of the [[nobility]] were beheaded with a sword or an axe, which often took two or more blows to kill the condemned. The condemned or their families would sometimes pay the executioner to ensure that the blade was sharp in order to achieve a quick and relatively painless death. Commoners were usually hanged, which could take many minutes. In the early phase of the French Revolution before the guillotine\'s adoption, the slogan \'\'[[À la lanterne]]\'\' (in [[English language|English]]: To the lamp post! String Them Up! or Hang Them!) symbolized popular justice in revolutionary France. The revolutionary radicals hanged officials and aristocrats from street [[lantern]]s and also employed more gruesome methods of execution, such as [[Breaking wheel|the wheel]] or [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]].\n\nHaving only one method of civil execution for all regardless of class was also seen as an expression of equality among citizens. The guillotine was then the only civil [[capital punishment in France|legal execution method in France]] until the abolition of the death penalty in 1981,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051020135642/http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/abolition-peine-mort/code-penal-dalloz.shtml Pre-1981 penal code, article 12]: "Any person sentenced to death shall be beheaded."</ref> apart from certain crimes against the security of the state, or for the death sentences passed by military courts,<ref>Pre-1971 Code de Justice Militaire, article 336: "Les justiciables des juridictions des forces armées condamnés à la peine capitale sont fusillés dans un lieu désigné par l\'autorité militaire."</ref> which entailed [[execution by firing squad]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051020135642/http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/abolition-peine-mort/code-penal-dalloz.shtml Pre-1981 penal code, article 13]: "By exception to article 12, when the death penalty is handed for crimes against the safety of the State, execution shall take place by firing squad.".</ref>\n\n===== Reign of Terror =====\n[[File:Execution of Louis XVI.jpg|thumb|right| The execution of Louis XVI]]\n[[File:Exécution de Marie Antoinette le 16 octobre 1793.jpg|right|thumb| Queen [[Marie Antoinette]]\'s execution on 16 October 1793]]\n[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|thumb|right|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]. Note that the person who has just been executed in this drawing is [[Georges Couthon]]; Robespierre is the figure marked "10" in the [[tumbrel]], holding a handkerchief to his shattered jaw.]]\n\nLouis Collenot d\'Angremont was a royalist famed for having been the first guillotined for his political ideas, on 21 August 1792. During the [[Reign of Terror]] (June 1793 to July 1794) about 17,000 people were guillotined, including former [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] and Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] who were executed at the guillotine in 1793. Towards the end of the Terror in 1794, revolutionary leaders such as [[Georges Danton]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] and [[Maximilien Robespierre]] were sent to the guillotine. Most of the time, executions in Paris were carried out in the Place de la Revolution (former Place [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and current [[Place de la Concorde]]); the guillotine stood in the corner near the Hôtel Crillon where the City of Brest Statue can be found today. The machine was moved several times, to the [[Place de la Nation]] and the [[Place de la Bastille]], but returned, particularly for the execution of the King and for Robespierre.\n\nFor a time, executions by guillotine were a popular form of entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators, with vendors selling programs listing the names of the condemned. But more than being popular entertainment alone during the Terror, the guillotine symbolized revolutionary ideals: equality in death equivalent to equality before the law; open and demonstrable revolutionary justice; and the destruction of privilege under the \'\'[[Ancien Régime]]\'\', which used separate forms of execution for nobility and commoners.<ref>{{Cite book|title="The Guilloine and the Terror"|last=Arasse|first=Daniel|publisher=Penguin|year=1989|location=London|pages=75–76}}</ref> The Parisian \'\'[[sans-culottes]]\'\', then the popular public face of lower-class patriotic radicalism, thus considered the guillotine a positive force for revolutionary progress.<ref>{{Cite book|title="Goodness Beyond Virtue: Jacobins During the French Revolution "|last=Higonnet|first=Patrice|publisher=Harvard|year=2000|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=283}}</ref>\n\n===== Retirement =====\n[[File:France - Public execution on Guillotine 1897.jpg|thumb|right|Public execution on Guillotine; Picture taken on 20 April 1897, in front of the jailhouse of [[Lons-le-Saunier]], Jura.

On 4 February 1832, the guillotine was moved behind the [[Saint-Jacques Tower|Church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie]], before being moved again, to the [[La Roquette Prisons|Grande Roquette prison]], on 29 November 1851.\n\nIn the late 1840s, the Tussaud brothers Joseph and Francis, gathering relics for [[Madame Tussauds]] wax museum, visited the aged [[Henry-Clément Sanson]], grandson of the executioner [[Charles-Henri Sanson]], from whom they obtained parts, the knife and lunette, of one of the original guillotines used during the Reign of Terror. The executioner had "pawned his guillotine, and got into woeful trouble for alleged trafficking in municipal property".<ref>Leonard Cottrell (1952) \'\'Madame Tussaud\'\', Evans Brothers Limited, pp. 142–43.</ref>\n\nOn 6 August 1909, the guillotine was used at the junction of the [[Boulevard Arago]] and the [[Rue de la Santé]], behind the [[La Santé Prison]].\n\nThe last public guillotining in France was of [[Eugen Weidmann]], who was convicted of six murders. He was beheaded on 17 June 1939 outside the prison Saint-Pierre, rue Georges Clemenceau 5 at [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], which is now the [[Palais de Justice (Versailles)|Palais de Justice]]. Numerous issues with the proceedings arose: inappropriate behavior by spectators, incorrect assembly of the apparatus, and secret cameras filming and photographing the execution from several storeys above. In response, the French government ordered that future executions be conducted in the prison courtyard in private.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe guillotine remained the official method of execution in France until the death penalty was abolished in 1981.<ref name="legifrance.gouv.fr"/> The final three guillotinings in France before its abolition were those of child-murderers [[Christian Ranucci]] (on 28 July 1976) in Marseille, [[Jérôme Carrein]] (on 23 June 1977) in Douai and torturer-murderer [[Hamida Djandoubi]] (on 10 September 1977) in Marseille. Djandoubi\'s death was the last time that the guillotine was used for an execution by any government.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn [[Germany]], the guillotine is known as the \'\'Fallbeil\'\' ("falling hatchet") or \'\'Köpfsmaschine\'\' ("head [cutting] machine") and was used in various German states from the 19th century onwards,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} becoming the preferred method of execution in [[Napoleonic]] times in many parts of the country. The guillotine and the [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] were the legal methods of execution during the era of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918) and the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933).\n\nThe original German guillotines resembled the French Berger 1872 model, but they eventually evolved into sturdier and more efficient machines. Built primarily of metal instead of wood, these new guillotines had heavier blades than their French predecessors and thus could use shorter uprights as well. Officials could also conduct multiple executions faster, thanks to a more efficient blade recovery system and the eventual removal of the tilting board (bascule). Those deemed likely to struggle were backed slowly into the device from behind a curtain to prevent them from seeing it prior to the execution. A metal screen covered the blade as well in order to conceal it from the sight of the condemned.\n\n[[Nazi Germany]] used the guillotine between 1933 and 1945 to execute 16,500 prisoners – 10,000 of them in 1944 and 1945 alone.<ref name="Opie2013">{{cite book|author=Robert Frederick Opie|title=Guillotine: The Timbers of Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ob87AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT131|year=2013|publisher=History Press|page=131|isbn=9780752496054}}</ref><ref>"According to Nazi records, the guillotine was eventually used to execute some 16,500 people between 1933 and 1945, many of them resistance fighters and political dissidents." https://www.history.com/news/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-guillotine</ref> One political victim the government guillotined was [[Sophie Scholl]], who was convicted of high treason after distributing anti-Nazi pamphlets at the [[University of Munich]] with her brother [[Hans Scholl|Hans]], and other members of the German student resistance group, the [[White Rose]].<ref name="Scholl 1983">{{cite book |last1=Scholl |first1=Inge |author-link=Inge Scholl |others=Schultz, Arthur R.

The guillotine replaced manual beheading in 1903, and it was used only once, in the execution of murderer [[Alfred Ander]] in 1910 at [[Långholmen Prison]], Stockholm. Ander was also the last person to be executed in Sweden before capital punishment was abolished there in 1921.<ref name="popularhistoria.se">{{cite web|url = http://popularhistoria.se/artiklar/affarside-vanskotsel-och-barnamord-anglamakerskan|title = Änglamakerskan|trans-title = The angel maker|work = Populär Historia|access-date = 1 December 2015|language = sv|last = Bolmstedt|first = Åsa|date = 21 December 2006|publisher = LRF Media|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171005050629/http://popularhistoria.se/artiklar/affarside-vanskotsel-och-barnamord-anglamakerskan|archive-date = 5 October 2017|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="hemmetsjournal.se">{{cite journal|url = http://www.hemmetsjournal.se/odenochaventyr/Artiklar/Reportage/Anglamakerskan-i-Helsingborg-drankte-atta-fosterbarn/|title = Änglamakerskan i Helsingborg dränkte åtta fosterbarn|trans-title=The angel maker in Helsingborg drowned eight foster care children|journal = [[Hemmets Journal]]|access-date = 1 December 2015|last = Rystad|first = Johan G.|date = 1 April 2015|language = sv|publisher = [[Egmont Group]]|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208134759/http://www.hemmetsjournal.se/odenochaventyr/Artiklar/Reportage/Anglamakerskan-i-Helsingborg-drankte-atta-fosterbarn/|archive-date = 8 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn [[South Vietnam]], after the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diệm]] regime enacted the 10/59 Decree in 1959, mobile special military courts were dispatched to the countryside in order to intimidate the rural population; they used guillotines, which had belonged to the former French colonial power, in order to carry out death sentences on the spot.<ref>{{cite book | author1 = Nguyen Thi Dinh | author2 = Mai V.

Foreground figures were painted in over a real photo.]]\n\nEver since the guillotine\'s first use, there has been debate as to whether or not the guillotine provided as swift and painless a death as Guillotin had hoped. With previous methods of execution that were intended to be painful, few expressed concern about the level of suffering that they inflicted. However, because the guillotine was invented specifically to be more humane, the issue of whether or not the condemned experiences pain has been thoroughly examined and has remained a controversial topic. While certain eyewitness accounts of guillotine executions suggest anecdotally that awareness may persist momentarily after decapitation, there has never been true scientific consensus on the matter.\n\n=== Living heads ===\nThe question of consciousness or awareness following decapitation remained a topic of discussion during the guillotine\'s use.\n\nThe following report was written by Dr. Beaurieux, who observed the head of executed prisoner Henri Languille, on 28 June 1905:\n\n{{quote|Here, then, is what I was able to note immediately after the decapitation: the eyelids and lips of the guillotined man worked in irregularly rhythmic contractions for about five or six seconds. This phenomenon has been remarked by all those finding themselves in the same conditions as myself for observing what happens after the severing of the neck ...\n\nI waited for several seconds. The spasmodic movements ceased. [...] It was then that I called in a strong, sharp voice: "Languille!" I saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions{{snd}}I insist advisedly on this peculiarity{{snd}}but with an even movement, quite distinct and normal, such as happens in everyday life, with people awakened or torn from their thoughts.\n\nNext Languille\'s eyes very definitely fixed themselves on mine and the pupils focused themselves. I was not, then, dealing with the sort of vague dull look without any expression, that can be observed any day in dying people to whom one speaks: I was dealing with undeniably living eyes which were looking at me. After several seconds, the eyelids closed again [...].\n\nIt was at that point that I called out again and, once more, without any spasm, slowly, the eyelids lifted and undeniably living eyes fixed themselves on mine with perhaps even more penetration than the first time. Then there was a further closing of the eyelids, but now less complete. I attempted the effect of a third call; there was no further movement{{snd}}and the eyes took on the glazed look which they have in the dead.<ref>{{cite web |title=\'\'Report From 1905\'\' |work=The History of the Guillotine |author=Dr. Beaurieux |url=http://www.guillotine.dk/pages/30sek.html |access-date=17 October 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125022453/http://www.guillotine.dk/Pages/30sek.html |archive-date=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Clinical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZc1AQAAMAAJ|year=1898|publisher=Medical Publishing Company|page=436}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\n== Names for the guillotine ==\nDuring the span of its usage, the French guillotine has gone by many names, some of which include:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* La Monte-à-regret (The Regretful Climb)<ref>[http://www.languefrancaise.net/bob/detail.php?id=8 abbaye de monte-à-regret : définition avec Bob, dictionnaire d\'argot, l\'autre trésor de la langue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314180326/http://www.languefrancaise.net/bob/detail.php?id=8 |date=14 March 2014 }}.
