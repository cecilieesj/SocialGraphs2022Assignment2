When Roman Britain was divided into four provinces in 197 AD, two were called [[Britannia Superior]] ({{Literal translation|Upper Britain}}) in the south and [[Britannia Inferior]] ({{Literal translation|Lower Britain}}) to the north. The name \'\'Britannia\'\' long survived the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] in the 5th century and yielded the name for the island in most European and various other languages, including the English [[Britain (place name)|Britain]] and the modern Welsh \'\'[[Prydain]]\'\'. In the 9th century the associated terms \'\'[[Bretwalda]]\'\' and \'\'Brytenwealda\'\' were applied to some Anglo-Saxon kings to assert a wider hegemony in Britain and hyperbolic inscriptions on coins and titles in charters often included the equivalent title \'\'rex Britanniae\'\'. However when England was unified the title used was \'\'rex Angulsaxonum\'\' (\'king of the Anglo-Saxons\').\n\nAfter centuries of declining use, the Latin form was revived during the [[English Renaissance]] as a rhetorical evocation of a British national identity.  Especially following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707, which joined the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the personification of the martial Britannia was used as an emblem of British maritime power and unity, most notably in the patriotic song "[[Rule, Britannia!]]".\n\nA [[List of cultural icons of the United Kingdom|British cultural icon]], she was featured on all modern British coinage series until the redesign in 2008, and still appears annually on the gold and silver "[[Britannia (coin)|Britannia]]" bullion coin series.

The Romans never successfully conquered the whole island, building [[Hadrian\'s Wall]] as a boundary with \'\'[[Caledonia]]\'\', which covered roughly the territory of modern [[Scotland]], although the whole of the boundary marked by Hadrian\'s Wall lies within modern-day [[Northern England]]. A southern part of what is now Scotland was occupied by the Romans for about 20 years in the mid-2nd century AD, keeping in place the [[Picts]] to the north of the [[Antonine Wall]]. People living in the Roman province of Britannia were called \'\'Britanni\'\', or [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]. Ireland, inhabited by the [[Scoti]], was never invaded and was called [[Hibernia]].

Early portraits of the goddess depict Britannia as a beautiful young woman, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]], and wrapped in a white garment with her right breast exposed. She is usually shown seated on a rock, holding a trident, and with a spiked shield propped beside her. Sometimes she holds a [[Standard-bearer|standard]] and leans on the shield. On another range of coinage, she is seated on a globe above waves: Britain at the edge of the (known) world.

Latin was ubiquitous amongst native [[Romano-British|Brythonic]] writers and the term continued in the [[Welsh Literature|Welsh tradition]] that developed from it. Writing with variations on the term \'\'Britannia\'\' (or \'\'[[Prydein]]\'\' in the native language) appeared in many Welsh works such as the \'\'[[Historia Britonum]]\'\', \'\'[[Armes Prydein]]\'\' and the 12th-century \'\'[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]\'\', which gained unprecedented popularity throughout western Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]].\n\nFollowing the migration of [[Celtic Britons|Brythonic]] Celts, the term \'\'Britannia\'\' also came to refer to the [[Armorica|Armorican peninsula]] (at least from the 6th century).<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last                  = Fleuriot\n| first                 = Léon\n| author-link            = Léon Fleuriot\n| title                 = Les Origines de la Bretagne: l\'émigration\n|trans-title=The origins of Brittany: emigration\n| year                  = 1980\n| publisher             = Payot\n| location              = Paris\n| language              = fr\n| isbn                  = 2228127108\n| pages                  = 52–53\n}}\n</ref> The modern English, French, Breton and Gallo names for the area, all derive from a literal use of \'\'Britannia\'\' meaning "land of the Britons". The two "Britannias" gave rise to the term \'\'Grande Bretagne\'\' (Great Britain) to distinguish the island of Britain from the continental peninsula.\n\nFollowing the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], the term \'"Briton" only referred to the [[Britons (historical)|native British]], Celtic-speaking inhabitants of the province; this remained the case until the modern era. The use of the term as an inhabitant of the island of [[Great Britain]] or the [[UK]] is relatively recent.<ref name=oed>{{cite web|title=Britishness|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50027736?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=Britishness&first=1&max_to_show=10|date=September 2008|access-date=14 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance and British Empire ===\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = \n| image1 = Reception of the American Loyalists.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \'\'Reception of the American Loyalists by Great Britain in the Year 1783\'\' engraved by [[Henry Moses (engraver)|Henry Moses]] after [[Benjamin West]].

In his 1576 "General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation", [[John Dee]] used a [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] figure of Britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching Elizabeth I, to protect her empire by strengthening her navy.<ref name=":2" />\n\nWith the death of Elizabeth in 1603 came the succession of her Scottish cousin, James VI, King of Scots, to the English throne. He became James I of England, and so brought under his personal rule the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] (and the dominion of Wales), [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. On 20 October 1604, [[James VI and I]] proclaimed himself as "King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland", a title that continued to be used by many of his successors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/britstyles.htm#1604|title=Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain|first=Francois|last=Velde|website=heraldica.org}}</ref> When James came to the English throne, some elaborate pageants were staged. One pageant performed on the streets of London in 1605 was described in [[Anthony Munday]]\'s \'\'Triumphs of Reunited Britannia\'\':\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:50PREVISEDBRITANNIA.jpg|thumb|Britannia on a 50p coin.]] -->\n\n<blockquote>On a mount triangular, as the island of Britain itself is described to be, we seat in the supreme place, under the shape of a fair and beautiful nymph, Britannia herself...</blockquote>\n\nBritain\'s first road atlas was updated in a series of editions titled from the early 18th into the early 19th century using the title \'\'[[Britannia Depicta]]\'\'.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], Britannia made her first appearance on English coins on a [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] of 1672 (see \'\'Depiction on British coinage and postage stamps\'\' below). With the constitutional unification of England with Scotland in 1707 and then with Ireland in 1800, Britannia became an increasingly important symbol and a strong rallying point among Britons.\n\nBritish power, which depended on a liberal political system and the supremacy of the [[Royal Navy|navy]], lent these attributes to the image of Britannia. By the time of [[Queen Victoria]], Britannia had been renewed. Still depicted as a young woman with brown or golden hair, she kept her [[Corinthian helmet]] and her white robes, but now she held [[Neptune\'s trident]] and often sat or stood before the ocean and tall-masted ships representing British naval power. She also usually held or stood beside a Greek [[hoplite]] shield, which sported the British [[Union Flag]]: also at her feet was often the British Lion, an animal found on the arms of England, Scotland and the Prince of Wales.\n\n[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] is shown symbolically passing his trident to Britannia in the 1847 fresco "Neptune Resigning to Britannia the Empire of the Sea" by [[William Dyce]], a painting Victoria commissioned for her [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].\n\n[[File:Triple Entente.jpg|thumb|left|1914 Russian poster depicting the [[Triple Entente]] – Britannia (right) and [[Marianne]] (left) flank [[Mother Russia]], with Britannia\'s association with the sea provided by an [[anchor]]]]\n\nNew Zealanders adopted a similar personification of their country in [[Zealandia (personification)|Zealandia]], Britannia\'s daughter, who appeared on postage stamps at the turn of the 20th century<ref>[http://stampsnz.com/1901_penny_universal.html 1901 Penny Universal], Stamps NZ.
