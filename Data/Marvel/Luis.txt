It is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] form of the originally [[Germanic language|Germanic]] name {{lang|gem|Hludowig}} or {{lang|gem|Chlodovech}}. Other [[Iberian Romance languages]] have comparable forms: \'\'\'{{lang|pt|Luís|italic=no}}\'\'\' (with an accent mark on the i) in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]], \'\'\'{{lang|ca|Lluís|italic=no}}\'\'\' in [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], while \'\'\'{{lang|pt-BR|Luiz|italic=no}}\'\'\' is archaic in Portugal, but common in [[Brazil]].\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Germanic name {{lang|gem|Chlodowig}} (and its variants) is usually said to be composed of the words for "fame" ({{wikt-lang|ang|hlūd}}) and "warrior" ({{wikt-lang|ang|wīġ}}) and hence may be translated to \'\'famous warrior\'\' or "famous in battle".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/ludwig|title=Ludwig at www.behindthename.com}}</ref> According to Dutch onomatologists however, it is more likely that the first stem was {{lang|frk|(h)lod-}}, meaning fame, which would give the meaning \'warrior for the gods\' (or: \'warrior who captured stability\') for the full name.<ref>J. van der Schaar, \'\'Woordenboek van voornamen\'\' (Prisma Voornamenboek), 4e druk 1990; see also the [http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/verklaring/naam/Lodewijk Lodewijs in the Dutch given names database].</ref>\n\nModern forms of the name are the [[German language|German]] name [[Ludwig (given name)|Ludwig]] and the Dutch form [[Lodewijk]]. {{lang|es|Luis}} and the other Iberian forms more closely resemble the [[French language|French]] name [[Louis (given name)|Louis]], a derivation of the [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] form [[Clovis (given name)|Clovis]], known from the kings of the Franks.
