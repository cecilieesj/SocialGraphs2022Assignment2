About 3,000 extant species of true dragonfly are known. Most are [[Tropics|tropical]], with fewer species in [[temperate regions]]. Loss of [[wetland]] habitat threatens dragonfly populations around the world. Adult dragonflies are characterized by a pair of large, multifaceted [[compound eye]]s, two pairs of strong, transparent [[insect wing|wings]], sometimes with coloured patches, and an elongated body. Many dragonflies have brilliant [[iridescent]] or metallic colours produced by [[structural colouration]], making them conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly\'s [[Arthropod eye|compound eyes]] have nearly 24,000 [[ommatidia]] each. \n\nDragonflies can be mistaken for the closely related [[damselflies]], which make up the other odonatan infraorder ([[Zygoptera]]) and are similar in [[body plan]] though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold their wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight. \n\nDragonflies are [[predatory insect]]s, both in their aquatic [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] stage (also known as \'\'naiads\'\') and as adults. In some species, the nymphal stage lasts for up to five years, and the adult stage may be as long as ten weeks, but most species have an adult lifespan in the order of five weeks or less, and some survive for only a few days.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cannings |first1=Robert A. |author2=Kathleen M. Stuart|date=1977 |title=The Dragonflies of British Columbia|page=19}}</ref>  They are fast, agile fliers capable of highly accurate aerial ambush, sometimes migrating across oceans, and often live near water. They have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction involving indirect insemination, delayed fertilization, and sperm competition. During mating, the male grasps the female at the back of the head, and the female curls her abdomen under her body to pick up sperm from the male\'s secondary genitalia at the front of his abdomen, forming the "heart" or "wheel" posture.\n\nFossils of very large dragonfly-like insects, sometimes called [[meganisoptera|griffinflies]], are found from 325&nbsp;million years ago (Mya) in [[Upper Carboniferous]] rocks; these had wingspans up to about {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=on}}, though they were only distant relatives, not true dragonflies. \n\nDragonflies are represented in human culture on artefacts such as pottery, rock paintings, statues and [[Art Nouveau]] jewellery. They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore. Their bright colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of [[Lord Tennyson]] and the prose of [[H. E. Bates]].\n\n==Evolution==\n[[File:Meganeura monyi au Museum de Toulouse.jpg|thumb|The giant [[Upper Carboniferous]] dragonfly relative, \'\'[[Meganeura monyi]]\'\', attained a wingspan around {{convert|680|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Biology of Dragonflies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J584AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA324 |publisher=CUP Archive |page=324 |id=GGKEY:0Z7A1R071DD |quote=No dragonfly at present existing can compare with the immense \'\'Meganeura monyi\'\' of the Upper Carboniferous, whose expanse of wing was somewhere about 27 inches.|date=2018-10-13 }}</ref> Museum of Toulouse]]\n[[File:Mesurupetala, dragonfly, Late Late Jurassic, Tithonian Age, Solnhofen Lithographic Limestone, Solnhofen, Bavaria, Germany - Houston Museum of Natural Science - DSC01817.JPG|thumb|\'\'[[Mesurupetala]]\'\', Late Jurassic ([[Tithonian]]), [[Solnhofen limestone]], Germany]]\n[[File:Dragonflies - oze national park - 2021 8 2.ogg|thumb|Dragonflies in [[Oze National Park]]]]\n\nDragonflies and their relatives are similar in structure to an ancient group, [[meganisoptera]], from the 325&nbsp;Mya Upper [[Carboniferous]] of Europe, a group that included the largest insect that ever lived, \'\'[[Meganeuropsis permiana]]\'\' from the [[Cisuralian|Early Permian]], with a wingspan around {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=on}};<ref name=Carde2009>{{cite book |last1=Resh |first1=Vincent H. |last2=Cardé |first2=Ring T. |title=Encyclopedia of Insects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jk0Hym1yF0cC&pg=PA722 |date=22 July 2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-092090-0 |page=722}}</ref>. Known informally as "griffinflies", their fossil record ends with the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] (about 247&nbsp;Mya). The [[Protanisoptera]], another ancestral group that lacks certain wing vein characters found in modern Odonata, lived from the Early to Late Permian age until the end Permian event, and are known from fossil wings from current-day United States, Russia, and Australia, suggesting they might have been cosmopolitan in distribution. While both of those groups are sometimes referred to as "giant dragonflies", in fact true dragonflies/odonata are more modern insects that had not evolved yet.\n\nModern dragonflies do retain some traits of their distant predecessors, and are in a group known as [[palaeoptera]], ancient-winged. They, like the gigantic pre-dinosaur griffinflies, lack the ability to fold their wings up against their bodies in the way modern insects do, although some evolved their own different way to do so. The forerunners of modern Odonata are included in a clade called the Panodonata, which include the basal Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (true dragonflies).<ref name=grimaldi >{{cite book |pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolutioninsects00grim_110/page/n189 175]–187 |title=Evolution of the Insects |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutioninsects00grim_110 |url-access=limited |last1=Grimaldi |first1=David |last2=Engel |first2=Michael S. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005|isbn=9780521821490 }}</ref> Today, some 3,000 species are extant around the world.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Zhang, Z.-Q.| title=Phylum Arthropoda von Siebold, 1848 In: Zhang, Z.-Q.

Nymphs feed on a range of freshwater invertebrates and larger ones can prey on [[tadpole]]s and small [[fish]].{{sfn|Dijkstra|2006|pages=8–9}} Adults capture insect prey in the air, making use of their acute vision and highly controlled flight. The mating system of dragonflies is complex, and they are among the few insect groups that have a system of indirect sperm transfer along with sperm storage, delayed fertilization, and sperm competition.{{sfn|Dijkstra|2006|pages=8–9}}\n\nAdult males vigorously defend territories near water; these areas provide suitable habitat for the nymphs to develop, and for females to lay their eggs. Swarms of feeding adults aggregate to prey on swarming prey such as emerging flying ants or termites.{{sfn|Dijkstra|2006|pages=8–9}}\n\n[[File:Libellula quadrimaculata m1.jpg|thumb|Habitat preference: A four-spotted chaser, \'\'[[Libellula quadrimaculata]]\'\' on an [[emergent vegetation|emergent plant]], the water violet \'\'[[Hottonia palustris]]\'\', with submerged vegetation in the background]]\nDragonflies as a group occupy a considerable variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements.{{sfn|Dijkstra|2006|pages=13–14}} Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water.{{sfn|Dijkstra|2006|pages=13–14}} Some species live in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as \'\'[[Sympetrum]]\'\' (darters)  have eggs and nymphs that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there.{{sfn|Dijkstra|2006|pages=13–14}} Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in \'\'[[Aeshna viridis]]\'\' (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the water-soldier, \'\'[[Stratiotes aloides]]\'\'.{{sfn|Dijkstra|2006|pages=13–14}} The chemistry of the water, including its trophic status (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and [[pH]] can also affect its use by dragonflies.

Some defend a territory against others of their own species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground; males of many species such as the [[blue dasher|\'\'Pachydiplax longipennis\'\']] (blue dasher) jostle other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there.{{sfn|Berger|2004|pp=32–34}} Defending a breeding territory is common among male dragonflies, especially in species that congregate around ponds. The territory contains desirable features such as a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, or the preferred [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, and the number of competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Dragonflies including [[black saddlebags|\'\'Tramea lacerata\'\']] (black saddlebags) may notice landmarks that assist in defining the boundaries of the territory. Landmarks may reduce the costs of territory establishment, or might serve as a spatial reference.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lojewski |first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Switzer |first2=Paul V. |title=The role of landmarks in territory maintenance by the black saddlebags dragonfly, Tramea lacerata |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-014-1847-z |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date=1 March 2015 |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=347–355 |doi=10.1007/s00265-014-1847-z |s2cid=17617885 |issn=1432-0762}}</ref> Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The [[common whitetail|\'\'Plathemis lydia\'\']] (common whitetail) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate with the territory holder before laying her eggs.{{sfn|Berger|2004|pp=32–34}} There is also [[Sexual conflict|conflict]] between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males to the extent that it affects their normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species females have evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fincke |first=Ola M. |title=Polymorphic signals of harassed female odonates and the males that learn them support a novel frequency-dependent model |journal=Animal Behaviour |year=2004 |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=833–845 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.04.017|s2cid=15705194 }}</ref> In some species females have evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Khelifa |first=Rassim |title=Faking death to avoid male coercion: Extreme sexual conflict resolution in a dragonfly |journal=Ecology |year=2017 |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=1724–1726 |doi=10.1002/ecy.1781 |pmid=28436995}}</ref> Similarly, selection of habitat by adult dragonflies is not random, and terrestrial habitat patches may be held for up to 3 months.

First, the male has to attract a female to his territory, continually driving off rival males. When he is ready to mate, he transfers a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment 9, near the end of his abdomen, to his secondary genitalia on segments 2–3, near the base of his abdomen.

The female in some families (Aeshnidae, Petaluridae) has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant on or near the water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping the surface of the water repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation.{{sfn|Berger|2004|p=39}} In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.<ref name=Lawlor>{{cite book|author=Lawlor, Elizabeth P.|title=Discover Nature in Water & Wetlands: Things to Know and Things to Do|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xo83huW7O6YC&pg=PA94|year=1999|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-2731-0|pages=88, 94–96}}</ref>\n\n===Life cycle===\n[[File:Larve d\'Anax empereur.JPG|thumb|left|Nymph of emperor dragonfly, \'\'[[Anax imperator]]\'\']]\n[[File:Dragonfly naiad mask.jpg|thumb|200px|Illustration of a naiad with mask extended]]\nDragonflies are [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] insects; they do not have a [[pupa]]l stage and undergo an incomplete [[metamorphosis]] with a series of nymphal stages from which the adult emerges.<ref name=IFAS>{{cite web |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/odonata/odonata.htm |title=Dragonflies and damselflies: Odonata |author=Bybee, Seth |date=1 May 2012 |work=Featured Creatures |publisher=University of Florida: Entomology and Nematology |access-date=1 March 2015}}</ref> Eggs laid inside plant tissues are usually shaped like grains of rice, while other eggs are the size of a pinhead, ellipsoidal, or nearly spherical.

The nymph extends its hinged labium (a toothed mouthpart similar to a lower mandible, which is sometimes termed as a "mask" as it is normally folded and held before the face) that can extend forward and retract rapidly to capture prey such as [[mosquito]] larvae, [[tadpole]]s, and small fish.<ref name=IFAS/> They breathe through gills in their [[rectum]], and can rapidly propel themselves by suddenly expelling water through the anus.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A |volume=97 |issue=4 |year=1975 |doi=10.1007/BF00631969 |pages=329–338 |title=Jet-propulsion in anisopteran dragonfly nymphs |author1=Mill, P.

When the naiad is ready to metamorphose into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a [[Phragmites|reed]] or other emergent plant, and moults ([[ecdysis]]). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its [[exoskeleton]] begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its nymph [[exoskeleton]], the [[exuvia]], arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping [[haemolymph]] into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.{{sfn|Berger|2004|pp=10–11}}\n\nDragonflies in temperate areas can be categorized into two groups, an early group and a later one. In any one area, individuals of a particular "spring species" emerge within a few days of each other. The [[Basiaeschna|springtime darner]] (\'\'Basiaeschna janata\'\'), for example, is suddenly very common in the spring, but disappears a few weeks later and is not seen again until the following year. By contrast, a "summer species" emerges over a period of weeks or months, later in the year. They may be seen on the wing for several months, but this may represent a whole series of individuals, with new adults hatching out as earlier ones complete their lifespans.{{sfn|Berger|2004|p=9}}\n\n===Sex ratios===\nThe [[sex ratio]] of male to female dragonflies varies both temporally and spatially. Adult dragonflies have a high male-biased ratio at breeding habitats. The male-bias ratio has contributed partially to the females using different habitats to avoid male harassment. As seen in Hine\'s emerald dragonfly (\'\'[[Somatochlora hineana]]\'\'), male populations use wetland habitats, while females use dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only migrating to the wetlands to lay their eggs or to find mating partners.

Being [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]], they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched, while in the middle of the day, a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The [[green darner]] (\'\'Anax junius\'\') is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable it to make an early start.{{sfn|Berger|2004|pp=44–46}}\n\nBecoming too hot is another hazard, and a sunny or shady position for perching can be selected according to the ambient temperature. Some species have dark patches on the wings which can provide shade for the body, and a few use the [[obelisk posture]] to avoid overheating. This behaviour involves doing a "[[handstand]]", perching with the body raised and the abdomen pointing towards the sun, thus minimising the amount of solar radiation received. On a hot day, dragonflies sometimes adjust their body temperature by skimming over a water surface and briefly touching it, often three times in quick succession. This may also help to avoid desiccation.{{sfn|Berger|2004|pp=44–46}}\n\n===Feeding===\n\n[[File:Gomphus vulgatissimus with a prey 002.jpg|thumb|Common clubtail, \'\'[[Gomphus vulgatissimus]]\'\', with prey]]\nAdult dragonflies hunt on the wing using their exceptionally acute eyesight and strong, agile flight.{{sfn|Trueman|Rowe|2009|page=Life Cycle and Behavior}} They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating a wide variety of insects ranging from small [[midge]]s and [[mosquito]]es to [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[moth]]s, [[Damselfly|damselflies]], and smaller dragonflies.<ref name="FAQ"/> A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch.

It was all confined, in true dragonfly fashion, to one small space. It was a continuous turning and returning, an endless darting, poising, striking and hovering, so swift that it was often lost in sunlight.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Bates |first1=H.

The [[neuron]]s contain [[gene]]s like those in the eye to make them sensitive to light. Miniature sensors, a computer chip and a [[solar panel]] were fitted in a "backpack" over the insect\'s thorax in front of its wings. Light is sent down flexible light-pipes named optrodes{{efn|Optrode is a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of "optical electrode".}} from the backpack into the nerve cord to give steering commands to the insect. The result is a "micro-aerial vehicle that\'s smaller, lighter and stealthier than anything else that\'s manmade".<ref name="Draper">{{cite web |title=Equipping Insects for Special Service |url=https://www.draper.com/news-releases/equipping-insects-special-service |publisher=Draper|date=19 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ackerman |first1=Evan |title=Draper\'s Genetically Modified Cyborg DragonflEye Takes Flight |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/drones/drapers-genetically-modified-cyborg-dragonfleye-takes-flight |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n=== General and cited sources ===\n* {{cite book |last=Berger |first=Cynthia |title=Dragonflies |year=2004 |url=https://archive.org/details/dragonflieswildg00cynt |url-access=registration |publisher=Stackpole Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/dragonflieswildg00cynt/page/2 2] |isbn=978-0-8117-2971-0}}\n* {{cite book |last=Corbet | first=Phillip S. |year=1999 |title=Dragonflies: Behavior and Ecology of Odonata |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press | pages=559–561 | isbn=978-0-8014-2592-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dijkstra |first=Klaas-Douwe B. |year=2006 |title=Field Guide to the Dragonflies of Britain and Europe |publisher=British Wildlife Publishing |isbn=978-0-9531399-4-1}}\n* {{cite book |last=Meister |first=Cari |year=2001 |title=Dragonflies |url=https://archive.org/details/dragonflies0000meis |url-access=registration |publisher=ABDO |page=[https://archive.org/details/dragonflies0000meis/page/16 16] |isbn=978-1-57765-461-2}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=Dan |year=1999 |title=A Guide to the Dragonflies of Great Britain |publisher=Arlequin Press |isbn=978-1-900-15901-2}}\n* {{cite web |last1=Trueman |first1=John W.
