He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in linguistics from the [[University of London]], and thereafter taught at various universities in the [[United Kingdom]]. He became a professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex.\n\nHe was considered an authority on the Basque language: his book ''The History of Basque'' (1997) is an essential reference on diachronic Basque linguistics and probably the best introduction to Basque linguistics as a whole. He was at work compiling an [[etymological dictionary]] of that language when he died; the unfinished work was posthumously published on the Internet by [[Max Wheeler (linguist)|Max W. Wheeler]].<ref>{{citation|author-last=Trask|author-first=R.
