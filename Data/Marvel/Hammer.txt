This can be, for example, to drive [[nail (fastener)|nails]] into [[wood]], to shape [[metal]] (as with a [[forge]]), or to crush [[Rock (geology)|rock]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hammer|title=hammer Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref><ref name="claw">{{Cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Hammer.html|title=How hammer is made - material, making, history, used, components, structure, steps|website=madehow.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications. Traditional disciplines include [[carpentry]], [[blacksmithing]], [[war hammer|warfare]], and [[mallet percussion|percussive]] musicianship (as with a [[gong]]).\n\n\'\'\'Hammering\'\'\' is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, as opposed to [[pry bar|prying]] with a secondary claw or [[grappling]] with a secondary hook. Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one [[arm]], in a lengthy downward [[plane (geometry)|planar]] arc—downward to add [[kinetic energy]] to the impact—pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc (but this is tiring). War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets. Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes. Use of hammers and heavy mallets for [[demolition]] must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, which can necessitate a [[club (weapon)|clubbing]] or [[golf swing|golfing]] motion with a two-handed grip.\n\nThe modern hammer head is typically made of [[steel]] which has been [[heat treating|heat treated]] for hardness, and the handle (also known as a [[wikt:haft#Noun|haft]] or [[wikt:helve#Noun|helve]]) is typically made of wood or [[plastic]].\n\nUbiquitous in [[framing (construction)|framing]], the [[claw hammer]] has a "claw" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in [[North America]]. Other types of hammer vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. Hammers used in many [[tradesman|trades]] include [[sledgehammer]]s, [[mallet]]s, and [[ball-peen hammer]]s. Although most hammers are hand tools, [[power hammer|powered hammers]], such as [[steam hammer]]s and [[trip hammer]]s, are used to deliver [[force]]s beyond the capacity of the human arm. There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Akins |first1=Ricky |title=40 Different Types of Hammers and Their Uses |url=https://www.garagetooladvisor.com/hand-tools/different-types-of-hammers-and-their-uses/ |website=Garage tool advisor |access-date=2018-10-29|date=2018-09-06 }}</ref>\n\nFor hand hammers, the grip of the shaft is an important consideration. Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work, and [[perspiration]] can lead to slippage from the hand, turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile. Steel is highly [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] and transmits [[shock (mechanics)|shock]] and [[vibration]]; steel is also a good conductor of heat, making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions. Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer to improve grip, dampen vibration, and to provide thermal insulation. A suitably contoured handle is also an important aid in providing a secure grip during heavy use. Traditional wooden handles were reasonably good in all regards, but lack strength and durability compared to steel, and there are safety issues with wooden handles if the head becomes loose on the shaft.\n\nThe high elasticity of the steel head is important in energy transfer, especially when used in conjunction with an equally elastic [[anvil]].\n\nIn terms of [[human physiology]], many uses of the hammer involve coordinated [[ballistic movement]]s under intense muscular forces which must be planned in advance at the [[motor system|neuromuscular level]], as they occur too rapidly for conscious adjustment in flight. For this reason, accurate striking at speed requires more practice than a tapping movement to the same target area. It has been suggested that the cognitive demands for pre-planning, sequencing and accurate timing associated with the related ballistic movements of [[throwing]], clubbing, and hammering precipitated aspects of [[brain evolution]] in early [[hominid]]s.<ref name=Calvin2004>{{cite book \n   |last=Calvin \n   |first=William H. \n   |author-link=William H.

This two-piece design is often used to combine a dense metallic striking head with a non-metallic mechanical-shock-absorbing handle (to reduce [[muscle fatigue|user fatigue]] from repeated strikes). If wood is used for the handle, it is often [[hickory]] or [[ash (tree)|ash]], which are tough and long-lasting materials that can dissipate [[shock wave]]s from the hammer head.<ref name="claw"/> Rigid [[fiberglass|fiberglass resin]] may be used for the handle; this material does not absorb water or decay but does not dissipate shock as well as wood.\n\nA loose hammer head is considered hazardous due to the risk of the head becoming detached from the handle while being swung becoming a dangerous uncontrolled projectile. Wooden handles can often be replaced when worn or damaged; specialized kits are available covering a range of handle sizes and designs, plus special wedges and spacers for secure attachment.\n\nSome hammers are one-piece designs made mostly of a single material. A one-piece metallic hammer may optionally have its handle coated or wrapped in a [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilient]] material such as [[Elastomer|rubber]] for improved grip and to reduce user fatigue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2014/08/06/hammers.html|title=A beginner\'s guide to hammers / Boing Boing|website=boingboing.net|date=6 August 2014|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\nThe hammer head may be surfaced with a variety of materials including [[brass]], [[bronze]], wood, plastic, rubber, or leather. Some hammers have interchangeable striking surfaces, which can be selected as needed or replaced when worn out.\n\n== Designs and variations ==\n[[File:Peen hammers.png|thumb|The parts of a hammer are the \'\'face\'\', \'\'head\'\' (includes the \'\'bell\'\' and \'\'neck\'\', which are not labeled), \'\'eye\'\' (where the \'\'handle\'\' fits into), \'\'peen\'\' (also spelled pein and pane). The side of a hammer is the \'\'cheek\'\' and some hammers have \'\'straps\'\' that extend down the handle for strength. Shown here are: A. Ball-peen hammer B. Straight-peen hammer C. Cross-peen hammer]]\n[[File:Prying up a long nail.jpg|thumb|upright|The claw of a carpenter\'s hammer is frequently used to remove nails.]]\nA large hammer-like tool is a \'\'maul\'\' (sometimes called a "beetle"), a wood- or rubber-headed hammer is a \'\'[[mallet]]\'\', and a hammer-like tool with a cutting blade is usually called a \'\'[[hatchet]]\'\'. The essential part of a hammer is the head, a compact solid mass that is able to deliver a blow to the intended target without itself deforming. The impacting surface of the tool is usually flat or slightly rounded; the opposite end of the impacting mass may have a ball shape, as in the [[ball-peen hammer]]. Some [[upholstery hammer]]s have a [[magnet]]ized face, to pick up tacks. In the hatchet, the flat hammer head may be secondary to the cutting edge of the tool.\n\nThe impact between steel hammer heads and the objects being hit can create [[Spark (fire)|sparks]], which may ignite [[flammable]] or [[explosive]] [[gas]]es. These are a [[hazard]] in some industries such as [[underground coal mining]] (due to the presence of [[methane]] gas), or in other hazardous environments such as [[petroleum refineries]] and [[chemical plant]]s. In these environments, a variety of non-sparking metal tools are used, primarily made of [[aluminium]] or [[beryllium copper]]. In recent years, the handles have been made of durable plastic or rubber, though wood is still widely used because of its shock-absorbing qualities and repairability.\n\n===Hand-powered===\n* [[Ball-peen hammer]],<ref name="bs876">\'\'British Standard BS 876:1995 Specification for Hand Hammers\'\'</ref> or mechanic\'s hammer\n* Boiler scaling hammer<ref name="bs876" />\n* Brass hammer, also known as non-sparking hammer or spark-proof hammer and used mainly in flammable areas like oil fields\n* Bricklayer\'s hammer\n* Carpenter\'s hammer (used for nailing), such as the [[framing hammer]] and the [[claw hammer]], and pinhammers (ball-peen and cross-peen types)<ref name="bs876" />\n* Cow hammer – sometimes used for [[animal slaughter|livestock slaughter]], a practice now [[deprecation|deprecated]] due to [[animal cruelty|animal welfare]] objections<ref name=FAO>{{cite web|title=Slaughter of livestock|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6909e/x6909e09.htm|website=FAO Corporate Document Repository|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-date=27 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627204715/http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6909e/x6909e09.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Cross-peen hammer,<ref name="bs876" /> having one round face and one wedge-peen face.\n* [[Dead blow hammer]] delivers impact with very little recoil, often due to a hollow head filled with sand, [[lead shot]] or pellets\n* Demolition hammer\n* [[Lump hammer|Drilling hammer]] – a short handled sledgehammer originally used for drilling in rock with a chisel.

When the hammer strikes, the head is stopped by an opposite force coming from the target, equal and opposite to the force applied by the head to the target. If the target is a hard and heavy object, or if it is resting on some sort of [[anvil]], the head can travel only a very short distance \'\'d\'\' before stopping. Since the stopping force \'\'F\'\' times that distance must be equal to the head\'s kinetic energy, it follows that \'\'F\'\' is much greater than the original driving force \'\'f\'\'—roughly, by a factor \'\'D\'\'/\'\'d\'\'. In this way, great strength is not needed to produce a force strong enough to bend steel, or crack the hardest stone.\n\n===Effect of the head\'s mass===\nThe amount of energy delivered to the target by the hammer-blow is equivalent to one half the mass of the head times the square of the head\'s speed at the time of impact <math>(E={mv^2 \\over 2})</math>. While the energy delivered to the target increases linearly with mass, it increases quadratically with the [[speed]] (see the effect of the handle, below). High tech [[titanium]] heads are lighter and allow for longer handles, thus increasing velocity and delivering the same energy with less arm fatigue than that of a heavier steel head hammer.<ref>{{cite web |title=DeWalt\'s Titanium Hammer Killer? |url=http://toolmonger.com/2011/06/15/dewalts-titanium-hammer-killer/ |date=2011-06-15 |author=Cage, Chuck |publisher=Toolmonger |access-date=2013-04-18}}</ref> A titanium head has about 3% [[Deflection (physics)|recoil]] energy and can result in greater efficiency and less fatigue when compared to a steel head with up to 30% recoil. [[Dead blow hammer]]s use special rubber or steel shot to absorb [[recoil]] energy, rather than bouncing the hammer head after impact.\n\n===Effect of the handle===\nThe handle of the hammer helps in several ways. It keeps the user\'s hands away from the point of impact. It provides a broad area that is better-suited for gripping by the hand. Most importantly, it allows the user to maximize the speed of the head on each blow. The primary constraint on additional handle length is the lack of space to swing the hammer. This is why sledgehammers, largely used in open spaces, can have handles that are much longer than a standard carpenter\'s hammer. The second most important constraint is more subtle. Even without considering the effects of fatigue, the longer the handle, the harder it is to guide the head of the hammer to its target at full speed.\n\nMost designs are a compromise between practicality and energy efficiency. With too long a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it delivers force to the wrong place, off-target. With too short a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it doesn\'t deliver enough force, requiring more blows to complete a given task. Modifications have also been made with respect to the effect of the hammer on the user. Handles made of shock-absorbing materials or varying angles attempt to make it easier for the user to continue to wield this age-old device, even as nail guns and other powered drivers encroach on its traditional field of use.\n\nAs hammers must be used in many circumstances, where the position of the person using them cannot be taken for granted, trade-offs are made for the sake of practicality. In areas where one has plenty of room, a long handle with a heavy head (like a sledgehammer) can deliver the maximum amount of energy to the target. It is not practical to use such a large hammer for all tasks, however, and thus the overall design has been modified repeatedly to achieve the optimum utility in a wide variety of situations.\n\n===Effect of gravity===\n[[Gravity]] exerts a force on the hammer head. If hammering downwards, gravity increases the [[acceleration]] during the hammer stroke and increases the [[energy]] delivered with each blow. If hammering upwards, gravity reduces the acceleration during the hammer stroke and therefore reduces the energy delivered with each blow. Some hammering methods, such as traditional mechanical [[pile driver]]s, rely entirely on gravity for acceleration on the down stroke.\n\n==Ergonomics and injury risks==\nA hammer may cause significant injury if it strikes the body. Both manual and powered hammers can cause [[peripheral neuropathy]] or a variety of other ailments when used improperly. Awkward handles can cause [[repetitive stress injury]] (RSI) to hand and arm joints, and uncontrolled shock waves from repeated impacts can injure nerves and the skeleton. Additionally, striking metal objects with a hammer may produce small metallic projectiles which can become lodged in the eye. It is therefore recommended to wear [[safety glasses]].\n\n==War hammers==\n{{Main article|War hammer}}\nA war hammer is a [[late medieval]] [[weapon]] of [[war]] intended for [[close combat]] action.\n\n==Symbolism==\n[[File:Tampere.vaakuna.svg|thumb|upright|A T-shaped hammer in the upper left corner of the coat of arms of [[Tampere]]]]\nThe hammer, being one of the most used tools by [[Homo sapiens|man]], has been used very much in symbols such as [[flag]]s and [[heraldry]]. In the Middle Ages, it was used often in blacksmith guild logos, as well as in many family symbols. The [[hammer and pick]] are used as a symbol of mining.\n\nIn mythology, the gods [[Thor]] ([[Norse mythology|Norse]]) and [[Sucellus]] ([[Ancient Celtic religion|Celtic]] and [[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman]]), and the hero [[Hercules]] ([[Greek mythology|Greek]]), all had hammers that appear in their lore and carried different meanings. Thor, the god of thunder and lightning, wields a hammer named [[Mjölnir]]. Many artifacts of decorative hammers have been found, leading modern practitioners of this religion to often wear reproductions as a sign of their faith.\n\nIn [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]], the hammer of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] represents the strength and endurance of a man.\n\nA political party in Singapore, [[Workers\' Party (Singapore)|Workers\' Party of Singapore]], based their logo on a hammer to symbolize the party\'s [[civic nationalism]] and [[social democracy]] ideology.\n\nA variant, well-known symbol with a hammer in it is the [[Hammer and Sickle]], which was the symbol of the former [[Soviet Union]] and is strongly linked to [[communism]] and early [[socialism]].  The hammer in this symbol represents the industrial working class (and the sickle represents the agricultural working class). The hammer is used in some coats of arms in former socialist countries like [[East Germany]]. Similarly, the Hammer and Sword symbolizes [[Strasserism]], a strand of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] seeking to appeal to the working class. Another variant of the symbol was used for the North Korean party, [[Workers\' Party of Korea]], incorporated with an [[ink brush]] on the middle, which symbolizes both [[Juche]] and [[Songun]] ideologies.\n\nIn [[Pink Floyd – The Wall]], two hammers crossed are used as a symbol for the fascist takeover of the concert during "[[In the Flesh (Pink Floyd song)|In the Flesh]]". This also has the meaning of the hammer beating down any "nails" that stick out.\n\nThe [[gavel]], a small wooden mallet, is used to symbolize a mandate to preside over a meeting or judicial proceeding, and a graphic image of one is used as a symbol of legislative or judicial decision-making authority.\n\n[[Judah Maccabee]] was nicknamed "The Hammer", possibly in recognition of his ferocity in battle. The name "Maccabee" may derive from the [[Aramaic]] \'\'maqqaba\'\'. (see {{section link|Judah Maccabee|Origin of Name "The Hammer"}}.)\n\nThe hammer in the song "[[If I Had a Hammer]]" represents a relentless message of justice broadcast across the land. The song became a symbol of the [[civil rights movement]].\n\n==Image gallery==\n<!-- Please ALPHABETIZE any additions -->\n<gallery class="center">\nFile:Buck Knives Hammer (5075278861).jpg|[[Ball-peen hammer]]\nFile:Stockhammer.JPG|[[Bush hammer]]\nFile:Hammer2.jpg|[[Claw hammer]]\nFile:Hammer-1.jpg|Cross-peen hammer\nFile:Hammer dog-head.jpg|Dog-head hammer (blacksmithing)\nFile:Framing hammer.jpg|[[Framing hammer]]\nFile:BrokenConcretion22.jpg|[[Geologist\'s hammer]]\nFile:Hifit-hammer.jpg|[[High-frequency impact treatment|HiFIT]]-hammer for aftertreatment of weld transitions\nFile:Hammer Long cross-face.jpg|Long cross-face hammer (blacksmithing)\nFile:Sledgehammer.jpg|Post maul\nFile:Climbing Hammer.png|[[Rock climbing hammer]]\nFile:Gummihammer.png|[[Rubber mallet]]\nFile:Sledgehammers-1.jpg|[[Sledgehammer]]s\nFile:Hammer straight pane sledge.jpg|Straight pane [[sledgehammer]]\nFile:Hammer twist.jpg|Twist hammer (blacksmithing)\nFile:Hammer tapissier.jpg|[[Upholstery hammer]]\nFile:Mallet menuisier.jpg|Wooden [[mallet]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Technology}}\n*[[Hammer Museum (Haines, Alaska)]]\n*[[Mjölnir]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hammers}}\n{{Wiktionary|hammer}}\n*[https://www.garagetooladvisor.com/hand-tools/different-types-of-hammers-and-their-uses/ Types of Hammers] (images and descriptions)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA164&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&sa=X&ei=awL8TqCkMcfXgQfW7uTxCQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzhu#v=onepage&q&f=true "Choosing a Hammer".] \'\'Popular Science\'\', June 1960, pp.&nbsp;164–167.\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Hand tools}}\n{{Metalworking navbox|toolopen}}\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hammers|*]]\n[[Category:Woodworking hand tools]]\n[[Category:Metalworking tools]]'}]}}
