He also reported that followers of the [[Bon|Bön]] religion once believed the blood of the "mi rgod" or "wild man" had use in certain spiritual ceremonies.

Several stories feature Yetis becoming helpers and disciples to religious figures. In Tibet, images of Yetis are paraded and occasionally worshipped as guardians against evil spirits. However, because Yetis sometimes act as enforcers of Dharma, hearing or seeing one is often considered a bad omen, for which the witness must accumulate [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]].<ref>Capper, Daniel S.

Hodgson concluded it was an [[orangutan]].\n\nAn early record of reported [[footprint]]s appeared in 1899 in [[Laurence Waddell]]\'s \'\'Among the Himalayas\'\'. Waddell reported his guide\'s description of a large apelike creature that left the prints, which Waddell thought were made by a bear. Waddell heard stories of bipedal, apelike creatures but wrote that "none, however, of the many Tibetans I have interrogated on this subject could ever give me an authentic case.

Tombazi later wrote that he observed the creature from about {{convert|200|to|300|yd|abbr=on}}, for about a minute. "Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf [[rhododendron]] bushes. It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes." About two hours later, Tombazi and his companions descended the mountain and saw the creature\'s prints, described as "similar in shape to those of a man, but only six to seven inches long by four inches wide...<ref>{{convert|6|to|7|in|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}}</ref> The prints were undoubtedly those of a biped."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abell |first1=George Ogden |last2=Singer |first2=Barry|year=1981|title=Science and The Paranormal: Probing the Existence of The Supernatural|publisher=Scribner|page=32|isbn=0-684-16655-0}}.</ref>\n\nWestern interest in the Yeti peaked dramatically in the 1950s. While attempting to scale [[Mount Everest]] in 1951, [[Eric Shipton]] took photographs of a number of large prints in the snow, at about {{convert|6000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.

He contended that while some animals do have a ridge of hair extending from the pate to the back, no animals have a ridge (as in the Pangboche scalp) running from the base of the forehead across the pate and ending at the nape of the neck.

From that research the conclusion was that the [[Asiatic black bear]], when about two years old, spends much time in trees to avoid attack by larger male bears on the ground (\'ground bears\'). During this tree period that may last two years, young bears train their inner claw outward, allowing an opposable grip. The imprint in the snow of a hind paw coming over the front paw that appears to have a hallux, especially when the bear is going slightly uphill so the hind paw print extends the overprint backward makes a hominoid-appearing track, both in that it is elongated like a human foot but with a "thumb" and in that a four-footed animal\'s gait now appears bipedal.<ref>Covey, Jacob (2006) \'\'Beasts: Traditional Hidden Creatures\'\', Seattle, Washington, Fantagraphic Books/WW Norton, pp. 191–93.</ref>  This "yeti discovery", in the words of \'\'[[National Geographic Magazine]]\'\' editor Bill Garrett, "[by] on-site research sweeps away much of the \'smoke and mirrors\' and gives us a believable yeti".<ref>Taylor, back cover.</ref>\n\nThis fieldwork in Nepal\'s Barun Valley led directly to initiating in 1984 [[Makalu-Barun National Park]] that protected over half a million acres in 1991, and across the border with China the [[Qomolangma national nature preserve]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] that protected over six million acres.
