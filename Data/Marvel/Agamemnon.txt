In order to recruit [[Odysseus]], who was feigning madness so as to not have to go to war, Agamemnon sent [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]], who threatened to kill Odysseus\' infant son [[Telemachus]].

There are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath: in [[Aeschylus]]\' play \'\'[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]\'\', Artemis is angry for the young men who will die at Troy, whereas in [[Sophocles]]\' \'\'[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]\'\', Agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to Artemis, and subsequently boasted that he was Artemis\' equal in hunting. Misfortunes, including a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and a lack of wind, prevented the army from sailing. Finally, the prophet [[Calchas]] announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of Agamemnon\'s daughter Iphigenia.\n\nClassical dramatizations differ on how willing either father or daughter was to this fate; some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to [[Achilles]], but Agamemnon did eventually sacrifice Iphigenia. Her death appeased Artemis, and the Greek army set out for Troy. Several alternatives to the [[human sacrifice]] have been presented in Greek mythology. Other sources, such as \'\'[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]\'\', say that Agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter, but that Artemis accepted a deer in her place, and whisked her away to Tauris in the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. [[Hesiod]] said she became the goddess [[Hecate]].\n\nDuring the war, but before the events of the \'\'Iliad\'\', Odysseus contrived a plan to get revenge on [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] for threatening his son’s life. By forging a letter from [[Priam]], king of the Trojans, and caching some gold in Palamedes tent, Odysseus had Palamedes accused of treason, and Agamemnon ordered him stoned to death.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ovid, Metamorphoses XII-XV|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26073/26073-h/Met_XII-XV.html#bookXIII|access-date=2021-05-18|website=www.gutenberg.org|archive-date=2022-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220303124439/https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26073/26073-h/Met_XII-XV.html#bookXIII|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== The \'\'Iliad\'\' ===\n[[File:Achilles Briseis MAN Napoli Inv9105 n01.jpg|thumb|[[Achilles]]\' surrender of [[Briseis]] to Agamemnon, from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], fresco, 1st century AD, now in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]]]\n\nThe \'\'Iliad\'\' tells the story about the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles in the final year of the war. In book 1, following one of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] Army\'s raids, [[Chryseis]], daughter of [[Chryses]], one of [[Apollo|Apollo\'s]] priests, was taken as a war prize by Agamemnon. Chryses pleaded with Agamemnon to free his daughter but was met with little success. Chryses then prayed to Apollo for the safe return of his daughter, which Apollo responded to by unleashing a plague over the Achaean Army. After learning from the Prophet [[Calchas]] that the plague could be dispelled by returning Chryseis to her father, Agamemnon reluctantly agreed (but first berated Calchas for previously forcing Agamemnon to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia) and released his prize. However, as compensation for his lost prize, Agamemnon demanded a new prize. He stole an attractive slave called [[Briseis]], one of the spoils of war, from Achilles. This created a rift between Achilles and Agamemnon, causing Achilles to withdraw from battle and refuse to fight.\n\nAgamemnon then received a dream from Zeus telling him to rally his forces and attack the Trojans in book 2. After several days of fighting, including duels between Menelaus and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], and between [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Hector]], the Achaeans were pushed back to the fortifications around their ships. In book 9, Agamemnon, having realized Achilles\'s importance in winning the war against the Trojan Army, sent ambassadors begging for Achilles to return, offering him riches and the hand of his daughter in marriage. Achilles refused, only being spurred back into action when [[Patroclus]] was killed in battle by [[Hector]], eldest son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba. In book 19 Agamemnon reconciled with Achilles, giving him the offered rewards for returning to the war, before Achilles went out to turn back the Trojans and duel Hector. After Hector\'s death, Agamemnon assisted Achilles in performing Patroclus\' funeral in book 23. Agamemnon volunteered for the javelin throwing contest, one of the games being held in Patroclus honor, but his skill with the javelin is so well known that Achilles awarded him the prize without contest.\n\nAlthough not the equal of Achilles in bravery, Agamemnon was a representative of "kingly authority". As commander-in-chief, he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle. His chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness; an over-exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult [[Chryses]] and Achilles, thereby bringing great disaster upon the Greeks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAgamemnon was the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Greeks during the Trojan War. During the fighting, Agamemnon killed [[Antiphus]] and fifteen other Trojan soldiers, according to one source.<ref>[[Hyginus]], \'\'[[Fabulae]]\'\' [https://topostext.org/work/206#114 114] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329161255/https://topostext.org/work/206#114 |date=2019-03-29 }}.</ref> In the \'\'[[Iliad]]\'\' itself, he is shown to slaughter hundreds more in Book 11 during his \'\'aristea,\'\' loosely translated to "day of glory", which is the most similar to Achilles\' \'\'aristea\'\' in Book 21. They both are compared to lions and destructive fires in battle, their hands are described as "splattered with gore" and "invincible," the Trojans flee to the walls, they both are appealed to by one of their victims, they are both avoided by Hector, they both are wounded in the arm or hand, and they both kill the one who wounded them. Even before his \'\'aristea,\'\' Agamemnon is considered to be one of the three best warriors on the Greek side, as proven when Hector challenges any champion of the Greek side to fight him in Book 7, and Agamemnon (along with Diomedes and Ajax the Greater) is one of the three Hector most wishes to fight out of the nine strongest Greek warriors who volunteer.\n\n=== End of the war ===\n[[File:Exekias_Suicide_d_Ajax_01.jpg|thumb|The suicide of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] depicted on [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek pottery]] by [[Exekias]], now on display at the Château-musée de [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]]]\n\nAccording to [[Sophocles|Sophocles\'s]] \'\'[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]],\'\' after Achilles had fallen in battle Agamemnon and Menelaus award Achilles armor to [[Odysseus]].

Ajax considers killing them, but is driven to madness by [[Athena]] and instead slaughters the herdsmen and cattle that had not yet been divided as spoils of war. He then commits suicide in shame for his actions. As Ajax dies he curses the sons of Atreus (Agamemnon and Menelaus), along with the entire Achaean army.

The curse begins with Agamemnon\'s great-grandfather Tantalus, who is in [[Zeus]]\'s favor until he tries to feed his son Pelops to the gods in order to test their [[omniscience]], as well as stealing some [[ambrosia]] and nectar. Tantalus is then banished to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], where he stands in a pool of water that evaporates every time he reaches down to drink, and above him is a fruit tree whose branches are blown just out of reach by the wind whenever he reaches for the fruit.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Pindar, Olympian, Olympian 1 For Hieron of Syracuse Single Horse Race 476 B.

The continued miasma surrounding the house of Atreus expresses itself in several events throughout their lives. Agamemnon is forced to sacrifice his own daughter, Iphigenia, to appease the gods and allow the Greek forces to sail for [[Troy]]. When Agamemnon refuses to return [[Chryseis (mythology)|Chryseis]] to her father [[Chryses of Troy|Chryses]], he brings plague upon the Greek camp. He is also later killed by his wife, Clytemnestra, who conspires with her new lover Aegisthus in revenge for the death of Iphigenia. Menelaus\'s wife, [[Helen of Troy]], runs away with [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], ultimately leading to the [[Trojan War]]. According to book 4 of the \'\'Odyssey,\'\' after the war his fleet is scattered by the gods to [[Egypt]] and [[Crete]]. When Menelaus finally returns home, his marriage with Helen is now strained and they produce no sons.<ref name=":3" /> Both Agamemnon and Menelaus are cursed by Ajax for not granting him Achilles\'s armor as he commits suicide.<ref name=":2" />\n\nAgamemnon and Clytemnestra have three remaining children, Electra, Orestes, and Chrysothemis. After growing to adulthood and being pressured by Electra, Orestes vows to avenge his father Agamemnon by killing his mother Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. After successfully doing so, he wanders the Greek countryside for many years constantly plagued by the [[Erinyes]] (Furies) for his sins.
