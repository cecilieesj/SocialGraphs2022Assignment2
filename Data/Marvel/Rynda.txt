Ryndy acted as bodyguards to the Russian court and accompanied the tsar on journeys and diplomatic missions, and would carry his weapons and armour and accompany him into battle. They were not [[court official]]s and were not paid for their service, being accommodated in the royal household. \nThe position was abolished by reforms of [[Peter the Great]] in 1698.\n\nThe ryndy had an exotic and imposing appearance. They wore white damask [[kaftan]]s trimmed with ermine and embroidered with silver lacing, white boots and tall [[Boyar hat|gorlatnayas]] made of white fox fur.\nTheir status was indicated by silk and gold sashes worn around their waists and golden chains worn around the torso. Ryndas carried heavily decorated [[bardiche]]s with gold and silver appliqués and bejewelled handles. Examples of these still exists in the [[Kremlin Armoury]].  \n[[File:Boguszowicz Reception of the Polish envoys.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[False Dmitriy I]] holding court, surrounded by ryndy]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Spatharios]]\n*[[Yeomen of the Guard]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Obsolete occupations]]\n[[Category:Tsardom of Russia]]\n[[Category:Bodyguards]]\n\n\n{{Russia-mil-stub}}"}]}}
