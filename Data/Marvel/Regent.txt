A regent or regency council may be formed \'\'ad hoc\'\' or in accordance with a constitutional rule. \'\'Regent\'\' is sometimes a formal title granted to a monarch\'s most trusted advisor or [[personal assistant]]. If the regent is holding their position due to their position in the [[Order of succession|line of succession]], the compound term \'\'[[prince regent]]\'\' is often used; if the regent of a minor is their mother, she would be referred to as \'\'[[queen regent]]\'\'.\n\nIf the formally appointed regent is unavailable or cannot serve on a temporary basis, a {{lang|la|regent ad interim}} may be appointed to fill the gap.\n\nIn a monarchy, a regent usually governs due to one of these reasons, but may also be elected to rule during the [[interregnum]] when the royal line has died out. This was the case in the [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Kingdom of Finland]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], where the royal line was considered extinct in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. In [[Kingdom of Iceland|Iceland]], the regent represented the [[King of Denmark]] as sovereign of Iceland until the country [[1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum|became a republic]] in 1944. In the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569–1795), kings were [[Royal elections in Poland|elective]], which often led to a fairly long interregnum. In the interim, it was the [[primate (bishop)|Roman Catholic primate]] (the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|archbishop of Gniezno]]) who served as the regent, termed the {{lang|la|[[Interrex (Poland)|interrex]]}} (Latin: ruler \'between kings\' as in ancient Rome). In the small republic of [[San Marino]], the two [[Captains Regent]], or {{lang|it|Capitani Reggenti}}, are elected semi-annually (they serve a six-month term) as joint heads of state and of government.\n\nFamous regency periods include that of the Prince Regent, later [[George IV]] of the United Kingdom, giving rise to many terms such as [[Regency era]] and [[Regency architecture]]. Strictly this period lasted from 1811 to 1820, when his father [[George III]] was insane, though when used as a period label it generally covers a wider period. [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] was Regent of France from the death of [[Louis XIV]] in 1715 until [[Louis XV]] came of age in 1723; this is also used as a period label for many aspects of French history, as {{lang|fr|[[Régence]]}} in French, again tending to cover a rather wider period than the actual regency. For a period of a month and a half, the [[Second French Empire]] was a regency. The [[Napoleon III|Emperor]] departed with his army, giving his political powers to his wife who essentially carried out all his roles and even sent him orders. He would never be able to return to France, and the empire ended as a regency two days after his defeat and imprisonment at the [[Battle of Sedan]]. The equivalent Greek term is {{lang|grc-Latn|epitropos}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|επιτρέπω|επίτροπος}}), meaning overseer.\n\n{{As of|2022|post=,}} [[Liechtenstein]] (under [[Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein]]) is the only country with an active regency. In 2016, at the age of 96, [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] became the oldest regent of any nation, when he became the regent for [[Vajiralongkorn|Rama X]] of Thailand. Previously this record was held by Prince Regent [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]] of Bavaria. \n\n==Other uses==\n[[File:Frans Hals - De regentessen van het oudemannenhuis.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|\'\'[[Regentesses of the Old Men\'s Almshouse]]\'\' in [[Haarlem]], [[Frans Hals]], 1664]]\nThe term regent may refer to positions lower than the ruler of a country. The term may be used in the governance of organisations, typically as an equivalent of "director", and held by all members of a governing board rather than just the equivalent of the chief executive.\n\nIn the Society of Jesus, a regent is an individual training to be a Jesuit and who has completed his novitiate and philosophy studies but has not yet progressed to theology studies. A regent in the Jesuits is often assigned to teach in a school or some other academic institution.\n\nSome [[university]] managers in [[North America]] are called regents, and a management board for a [[college]] or [[university]] may be titled the "[[Board of Regents]]" {{citation needed|date=May 2020}}. In [[New York (state)|New York State]], all activities related to public and private education ([[P-12 (education)|P-12]] and [[Higher education|postsecondary]]) and professional licensure are administered by the [[Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York]], the appointed members of which are called regents.\n\n=== Europe ===\nThe term "regent" is also used for members of governing bodies of institutions such as the national banks of [[France]] and [[Belgium]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Republic]], the members of the ruling class, not formally hereditary but forming a [[de facto]] [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] class, were informally known collectively as \'\'[[regenten]]\'\' (the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] plural for \'\'regent\'\') because they typically held positions as "regent" on the boards of town councils, as well as charitable and civic institutions. The [[regents group portrait]], \'\'regentenstuk\'\' or \'\'regentessenstuk\'\' for female boards in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], literally "regents\' piece", is a group portrait of the board of trustees, called regents or regentesses, of a [[charitable organization]] or [[guild]]. This type of group portrait was popular in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nAgain in Belgium and France{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (\'\'régent\'\' in French, or in Dutch), "regent" is the official title of a teacher in a lower secondary school ([[junior high school]]), who does not require a [[college degree]] but is trained in a specialized \'\'école normale\'\' ([[normal school]]).\n\n=== Southeast Asia ===\n \nIn the [[Dutch East Indies]], a regent was a native prince allowed to rule \'\'de facto\'\' colonized \'state\' as a {{lang|nl|regentschap}}. Consequently, in the successor state of [[Indonesia]], the term regent is used in English to mean a \'\'bupati\'\', the head of a \'\'[[Regency (Indonesia)|kabupaten]]\'\' (second level local government).\n\nIn [[Malaysia]], a regent or "pemangku raja" in Malay is the interim ruler of a Malay state if the king is elected as the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], or is unable to assume the role as head of state. For example, the regent of [[Pahang]], [[Tengku Hassanal Ibrahim Alam Shah]] held the post after his father, [[Abdullah of Pahang]] was elected as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in 2019.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]]{{snd}} specifically, the [[University of Santo Tomas]]{{snd}} the Father Regent, who must be a [[Dominican Order|Dominican priest]] and is often also a teacher, serves as the institution\'s spiritual head. They also form the Council of Regents that serves as the highest administrative council of the university.\n\n=== Africa ===\nIn [[Eswatini]], where [[Succession to the Swazi throne|succession to the throne]] is not immediate, the [[Ndlovukati]], a position similar to [[queen mother]], rules as regent until the new king is determined.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Editor|first=A.
