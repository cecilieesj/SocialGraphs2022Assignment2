The ferret is most likely a domesticated form of the wild [[European polecat]] (\'\'Mustela putorius\'\'), evidenced by their [[Hybrid (biology)|interfertility]]. Other mustelids include the [[stoat]], [[badger]] and [[mink]].\n\nPhysically, ferrets resemble other mustelids because of their long, slender bodies. Including their tail, the average length of a ferret is about {{cvt|50|cm}}; they weigh between {{cvt|0.7|and|2.0|kg}}; and their fur can be black, brown, white, or a mixture of those colours. In this [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species, males are considerably larger than females.\n\nFerrets may have been domesticated since [[ancient times]], but there is widespread disagreement because of the sparseness of written accounts and the inconsistency of those which survive. Contemporary scholarship agrees that ferrets were bred for sport, hunting [[rabbit]]s in a practice known as [[rabbiting]]. In [[North America]], the ferret has become an increasingly prominent choice of household [[pet]], with over five million in the [[United States]] alone. The legality of ferret ownership varies by location. In [[New Zealand]] and some other countries, restrictions apply due to the damage done to native fauna by [[feral]] colonies of [[polecat–ferret hybrid]]s. The ferret has also served as a fruitful research animal, contributing to research in [[neuroscience]] and [[Infection|infectious disease]], especially [[influenza]].\n\nThe domestic ferret is often confused with the [[black-footed ferret]] (\'\'Mustela nigripes\'\'), a species native to North America.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fox|first1=James G.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863695703|title=Biology and Diseases of the Ferret|last2=Marini|first2=Robert P.|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-78273-6|edition=3rd|location=Ames, Iowa|pages=5|oclc=863695703|access-date=2021-12-31|archive-date=2022-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220105232948/https://www.worldcat.org/title/biology-and-diseases-of-the-ferret/oclc/863695703|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name "ferret" is derived from the Latin \'\'furittus\'\', meaning "little thief", a likely reference to the common ferret penchant for secreting away small items.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ferret ferret] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424030339/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ferret |date=2009-04-24 }}.

Please update it if the section title is changed. -->\n[[Image:XenoFerret.jpg|thumb|Typical ferret coloration, known as a sable or polecat-colored ferret]]\n\nMost ferrets are either albinos, with white fur and pink eyes, or display the typical dark masked sable coloration of their wild polecat ancestors. In recent years fancy breeders have produced a wide variety of colors and patterns. Color refers to the color of the ferret\'s guard hairs, undercoat, eyes, and nose; pattern refers to the concentration and distribution of color on the body, mask, and nose, as well as white markings on the head or feet when present. Some national organizations, such as the American Ferret Association, have attempted to classify these variations in their showing standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ferret.org/events/colors/colorchart.html |title=American Ferret Association: Ferret Color and Pattern Standards |publisher=Ferret.org |access-date=2008-11-30 |archive-date=2008-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209073612/http://www.ferret.org/events/colors/colorchart.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThere are four basic colors. The sable (including chocolate and dark brown), albino, dark eyed white (DEW, also known as black eyed white or BEW), and silver. All the other colors of a ferret are variations on one of these four categories.\n\n===Waardenburg-like coloring===\n[[Image:Coco 4056.JPG|right|thumb|White or albino ferret]]\n\nFerrets with a white stripe on their face or a fully white head, primarily blazes, badgers, and pandas, almost certainly carry a congenital defect which shares some similarities to [[Waardenburg syndrome]]. This causes, among other things, a cranial deformation in the womb which broadens the skull, white face markings, and also partial or total deafness. It is estimated as many as 75&nbsp;percent of ferrets with these Waardenburg-like colorings are deaf.\n\nWhite ferrets were favored in the [[Middle Ages]] for the ease in seeing them in thick undergrowth. Leonardo da Vinci\'s painting \'\'[[Lady with an Ermine]]\'\' is likely mislabelled; the animal is probably a ferret, not a [[stoat]], (for which "ermine" is an alternative name for the animal in its white winter coat). Similarly, the ermine portrait of [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth the First]] shows her with her pet ferret, which has been decorated with painted-on [[Heraldry|heraldic]] ermine spots.\n\n\'\'The Ferreter\'s Tapestry\'\' is a 15th-century tapestry from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy, France]], now part of the Burrell Collection housed in the Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries. It shows a group of peasants hunting rabbits with nets and white ferrets. This image was reproduced in \'\'Renaissance Dress in Italy 1400–1500\'\', by Jacqueline Herald, Bell & Hyman.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Herald |first=Jacqueline |year=1981 |title=Renaissance Dress in Italy 1400–1500 |series=History of Dress 2 |location=London |publisher=Bell & Hyman |isbn=0-391-02362-4 |oclc=925257752}}</ref>\n\n\'\'Gaston Phoebus\' Book of the Hunt\'\' was written in approximately 1389 to explain how to hunt different kinds of animals, including how to use ferrets to hunt rabbits.

To cross a border within the EU, ferrets require at minimum an EU PETS passport and an identification microchip (though some countries will accept a tattoo instead). Vaccinations are required; most countries require a rabies vaccine, and some require a [[Canine distemper|distemper]] vaccine and treatment for ticks and fleas 24 to 48 hours before entry. Ferrets occasionally need to be quarantined before entering the country. PETS travel information is available from any EU veterinarian or on government websites.\n* \'\'\'New Zealand\'\'\' - New Zealand has banned the import of ferrets into the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.govt.nz/personal/move-to-nz-permanently/import-pets-and-animals/|title=Import pets and animals|website=Customs.govt.nz|access-date=15 February 2022}}</ref>\n* \'\'\'United Kingdom\'\'\'&nbsp;– The UK accepts ferrets under the EU\'s PETS travel scheme. Ferrets must be microchipped, vaccinated against [[rabies]], and documented. They must be treated for [[tick]]s and [[tapeworms]] 24 to 48 hours before entry. They must also arrive via an authorized route. Ferrets arriving from outside the EU may be subject to a six-month quarantine.<ref>{{cite web |title=PETS: How to bring your ferret into or back into the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) |work=Animal health & welfare |publisher=Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (defra) Crown copyright 2006 |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/pets/ferretpets.htm |access-date=2006-09-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901095759/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/pets/ferretpets.htm |archive-date=2006-09-01}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ferret-legging]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--ref name=Lewington>{{cite book |first=John H. |last=Lewington |title=Ferret Husbandry, Medicine and Surgery |edition=2nd |publisher=Elsevier |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7020-2827-4|page=6}}</ref-->\n<ref name=jurek1998>Jurek, R.
