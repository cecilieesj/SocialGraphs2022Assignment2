Broadly, the term means any kind of purposeful mark, such as a simple vertical line incised on a building, a single letter in a script, or a carved symbol. \n{{Orthography notation}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term has been used in English since 1727, borrowed from \'\'glyphe\'\' (in use by French antiquaries since 1701), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γλυφή, \'\'glyphē\'\', "carving," and the verb γλύφειν, \'\'glýphein\'\', "to hollow out, engrave, carve" (cognate with Latin \'\'glubere\'\' "to peel" and English \'\'cleave\'\').<ref>see the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] under headword "cleave" for the cited Greek etymology.</ref>\n\nThe word \'\'[[hieroglyph]]\'\' (Greek for sacred writing) has a longer history in English, dating from an early use in an English-to-Italian dictionary published by [[John Florio]] in 1598, referencing the complex and mysterious characters of the Egyptian alphabet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/86804#eid1583426|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=oed.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref>\nThe word \'\'glyph\'\' first came to widespread European attention with the engravings and lithographs from [[Frederick Catherwood]]\'s drawings of undeciphered glyphs of the [[Maya civilization]] in the early 1840s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/maya.html|title=Maya|website=Ancientscripts.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212062541/http://ancientscripts.com/maya.html|archive-date=12 December 2010|access-date=6 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:RomanDoricOrderEngraving.jpg|thumb|upright 0.75|The Roman Doric order from the [[Theater of Marcellus]]: triglyphs centered over the end column]]\nIn architecture, the term glyph is used to describe a vertical mark in the facade of a building. One of the most well-known form of this is the [[triglyph]] (three glyphs), the vertical bands of the [[Doric order|Doric]] [[frieze]] in [[classical architecture]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Britannica | title=Triglyph: architecture: use in Doric order | url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/triglyph |access-date=26 September 2021}}</ref> \n\n{{clr}}\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:MAYA-g-log-cal-D10-Ok.svg|thumb|right|[[Maya script|Mayan glyph]] for Day 10 of the [[tzolkin]] calendar]]\nIn archaeology, a glyph is a carved or inscribed symbol.<ref>{{cite dictionary | dictionary= vocabulary.com | title=Glyph | url=https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/glyph |access-date=26 September 2021}}</ref> It may be a [[pictogram]] or [[ideogram]], or part of a [[writing system]] such as a [[syllabary|syllable]], or a [[logogram]].\n\n{{clr}}\n==Typography==\n[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|Various glyphs representing the lower case letter "[[a]]"; they are [[allograph]]s of the [[grapheme]] {{angbr|a}}]]\nIn typography, a glyph is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of symbols, intended to represent a readable character for the purposes of [[writing]]. Glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word or contribute to a specific meaning of what is written, with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage.\n\nA glyph is "the specific shape, design, or representation of a character".<ref>{{cite web |title= Confusing (and Frequently Misused) Type Terminology, Part 1 |work= fonts.com|publisher= Monotype Imaging |url=https://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/situationaltypography/confusingtypeterms.htm |author=Ilene Strizver |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225024213/https://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/situationaltypography/confusingtypeterms.htm |archive-date=25 December 2011}}</ref> It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular [[typeface]], of an element of written language, which could be a [[grapheme]], or part of a grapheme, or sometimes several graphemes in combination (a composed glyph).{{efn|For example, the sequence \'\'fi\'\' contains two characters, but can be represented by one glyph, the two characters being combined into a single unit known as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]].\nConversely, some older models of [[typewriter]]s require the use of multiple glyphs to depict a single character, as an overstruck [[apostrophe]] and [[full stop|period]] to create an [[exclamation mark]]}} If there is more than one allograph of a unit of writing, and the choice between them depends on context or on the preference of the author, they now have to be treated as separate glyphs, because mechanical arrangements have to be available to differentiate between them and to print whichever of them is required. The same is true in [[computing]]. In computing as well as typography, the term "[[character (computing)|character]]" refers to a grapheme or grapheme-like unit of text, as found in [[natural language]] [[writing system]]s (\'\'scripts\'\'). In typography and computing, the range of graphemes is broader than in a written language in other ways too: a typeface often has to cope with a range of different languages each of which contribute their own graphemes, and it may also be required to print non-linguistic symbols such as [[dingbat]]s. The range of glyphs required increases correspondingly. In summary, in typography and computing, a glyph is a [[graphics|graphical]] unit.<ref>{{cite web | title= Characters Vs Glyphs |author1=Ken Whistler |author2=Mark Davis |author3=Asmus Freytag | date = 2008-11-11 | url= http://unicode.org/reports/tr17/#CharactersVsGlyphs | publisher=Unicode Consortium}}</ref>\n\n===Distinctions===\n{{More citations|section|date=September 2021}}\n[[Image:Garamond type ſi-ligature.jpg|thumb|The adjacent characters, {{char|ſ}} ([[long s]]) and {{char|i}} (that would separately be represented by two distinct graphemes {{angbr|ſ}} and {{angbr|i}}), represented as a single glyph ([[typographic ligature]]), {{char|ſi}}]]\nIn most languages written in any variety of the [[Latin alphabet]], the [[Tittle|dot]] on a lower-case {{angbr|i}} is not a glyph because it does not convey any distinction, and an {{angbr|ı}} in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognized correctly. However, in [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]] this dot is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter \'\'i\'\', [[İ|with]] and [[Dotless I|without a dot]].  Also, in Japanese [[syllabary|syllabaries]], some of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark, but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves. However, in some cases, additional marks fulfill the role of [[diacritic]]s, to differentiate distinct characters. Such additional marks constitute glyphs.  In general, a diacritic is a glyph, even if it is contiguous with the rest of the character like a [[cedilla]] in [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the [[ogonek]] in several languages, or the stroke on a Polish "[[Ł]]".\n\nSome characters such as "[[æ]]" in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the "[[ß]]" in [[German language|German]] may be regarded as glyphs. They were originally typographic ligatures, but over time have become characters in their own right; these languages treat them as unique letters. However, a ligature such as "fi", that is treated in some typefaces as a single unit, is arguably not a glyph as this is just a design choice of the typeface, essentially an [[allograph]]ic feature, and includes more than one [[grapheme]]. In normal handwriting, even long words are often written "joined up", without the pen leaving the paper, and the form of each written letter will often vary depending on which letters precede and follow it, but that does not make the whole word into a single glyph.\n\n==See also==\n\n* {{Annotated link |Anaglyph 3D}}\n* {{Annotated link |Arabic Presentation Forms-B|Basic Glyphs for Arabic Language}}{{snd}}Unicode code block \'\'Arabic Presentation Forms-B\'\'\n* [[Builder\'s signature]] {{snd}}Architectural glyph denoting authorship\n* {{Annotated link |Character encoding}}\n* {{Annotated link |Complex text layout}}\n* {{Annotated link |Diacritic}}\n* {{Annotated link |Hieroglyph}}\n* {{Annotated link |Letterform}}\n* {{Annotated link |Letter cutting}}\n* {{Annotated link |Ornament (art)}}\n* {{Annotated link |Palaeography}}\n* {{Annotated link |Petroglyph}}\n* {{Annotated link |Punchcutting}}\n* {{Annotated link |Sort (typesetting)}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Lexicology}}\n{{Typography terms}}\n\n[[Category:Archaeological terminology]]\n[[Category:Graphemes]]\n[[Category:Glyphs| ]]\n[[Category:Infographics]]\n[[Category:Typographical symbols]]\n[[Category:Typography]]'}]}}
