There are four living [[species]], three of which are very common and widespread while the fourth is rarer and classified as [[near-threatened]] by the [[IUCN]]. The term \'\'snakebird\'\' is usually used without any additions to signify whichever of the completely [[allopatric]] species occurs in any one region. It refers to their long thin neck, which has a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged, or when mated pairs twist it during their bonding [[display (zoology)|displays]]. "Darter" is used with a [[geographic]]al term when referring to particular species. It alludes to their manner of procuring food, as they impale [[fish]]es with their thin, pointed [[beak]]. The American darter (\'\'A. anhinga\'\') is more commonly known as the [[anhinga]]. It is sometimes called "water turkey" in the southern United States; though the anhinga is quite unrelated to the [[wild turkey]], they are both large, blackish birds with long tails that are sometimes hunted for food.<ref name = abm2009>Answers.com [2009], BLI (2009), Myers et al. [2009]</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Anhinga-in-flight.jpg|thumb|left|Female [[anhinga]] (\'\'A. anhinga\'\') taking off]]\n[[File:Australasian Darter.jpg|thumb|left|Australasian darter drying its wings]]\nAnhingidae are large birds with [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] [[plumage]]. They measure about {{convert|80|to|100|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in length, with a wingspan around {{convert|120|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, and weigh some {{convert|1050|to|1350|g|oz}}. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, a short erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage, especially on the neck and underparts, and are a bit larger overall. Both have grey stippling on long [[scapular]]s and upper [[wing covert]]s.  The sharply pointed [[beak|bill]] has serrated edges, a [[desmognath]]ous [[palate]] and no external [[nostril]]s. The darters have completely [[webbed feet]], and their legs are short and set far back on the body.<ref>Brodkorb & Mourer-Chauviré (1982), Myers et al. [2009]</ref>\n\nThere is no [[eclipse plumage]], but the bare parts vary in color around the year. During breeding, however, their small [[gular sac]] changes from pink or yellow to black, and the bare facial skin, otherwise yellow or yellow-green, turns [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]]. The [[iris (eye)|iris]] changes in color between yellow, red or brown seasonally. The young hatch naked, but soon grow white or tan [[down (feather)|down]].<ref name = myersetal2009>Myers et al. [2009]</ref>\n\nDarter vocalizations include a clicking or rattling when flying or perching. In the nesting colonies, adults communicate with croaks, grunts or rattles. During breeding, adults sometimes give a \'\'caw\'\' or sighing or hissing calls. [[Nestling]]s communicate with squealing or squawking calls.<ref name = myersetal2009 />\n\n== Distribution and ecology ==\n\n[[File:Darterfemale.jpg|thumb|left|Female [[Australasian darter]], \'\'Anhinga novaehollandiae\'\', drying its wings]]\n[[File:Snake bird nesting.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oriental darter]] nesting colony at [[Kalletumkara]] ([[Kerala]], [[India]])]]\n[[File:Anhinga male in breeding plumage.jpg|thumb|right|Male [[anhinga]] (\'\'A. anhinga\'\') in breeding plumage]]\nDarters are mostly [[tropical]] in distribution, ranging into [[subtropical]] and barely into warm [[temperate]] regions. They typically inhabit [[fresh water]] lakes, rivers, marshes, swamps, and are less often found along the seashore in [[brackish water|brackish]] estuaries, bays, [[lagoon]]s and [[mangrove]]. Most are sedentary and do not [[bird migration|migrate]]; the populations in the coolest parts of the range may migrate however. Their preferred mode of [[bird flight|flight]] is [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] and [[gliding]]; in [[flapping]] flight they are rather cumbersome. On dry land, darters walk with a high-stepped gait, wings often spread for balance, just like [[pelican]]s do. They tend to gather in flocks – sometimes up to about 100 birds – and frequently associate with [[stork]]s, [[heron]]s or [[ibis]]es, but are highly territorial on the nest: despite being a colonial nester, breeding pairs – especially males – will stab at any other bird that ventures within reach of their long neck and bill. The [[Oriental darter]] (\'\'A. melanogaster [[sensu stricto]]\'\') is a [[Near Threatened]] species. [[Habitat destruction]] along with other human interferences (such as egg collection and [[pesticide]] overuse) are the main reasons for declining darter populations.<ref name = abm2009 />\n\n=== Diet ===\nDarters feed mainly on mid-sized [[fish]];<ref>E.g. [[Centrarchidae]] (sunfishes), [[Cichlidae]] (cichlids), [[Cyprinidae]] (carps, minnows and relatives), [[Cyprinodontidae]] (pupfishes), [[Mugilidae]] (mullets), [[Plotosidae]] (eeltail catfishes) and [[Poeciliidae]] (livebearers): Myers et al. [2009]</ref> far more rarely, they eat other [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[vertebrate]]s<ref>E.g. [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (frogs and toads), [[Caudata]] (newts and salamanders), [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s and even baby [[crocodilia]]ns: Myers et al. [2009]</ref> and large [[invertebrate]]s<ref>E.g. [[Crustacea]] (crabs, crayfish and shrimps), [[insect]]s, [[leech]]es and [[mollusk]]s: Myers et al. [2009]</ref> of comparable size. These birds are foot-propelled divers which quietly stalk and ambush their prey; then they use their sharply pointed [[beak|bill]] to impale the food animal. They do not dive deep but make use of their low buoyancy made possible by wettable plumage, small air sacs and denser bones.<ref>{{cite journal| journal= J. Avian Biol. |volume=38|pages=507–514|year=2007| title= Diving in shallow water: the foraging ecology of darters (Aves: Anhingidae)| author=Ryan, PG|issue=4| doi=10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04070.x}}</ref> On the underside of the [[cervical vertebra]]e 5–7 is a keel, which allows for [[muscle]]s to attach to form a [[hinge]]-like mechanism that can project the neck, head and bill forward like a [[throwing spear]]. After they have stabbed the prey, they return to the surface where they toss their food into the air and catch it again, so that they can swallow it head-first. Like [[cormorant]]s, they have a vestigial [[preen gland]] and their plumage gets wet during diving. To dry their feathers after diving, darters move to a safe location and spread their wings.<ref name = myersetal2009 /> Darters go through a synchronous [[moult]] of all their primaries and secondaries making them temporarily flightless, although it is possible that some individuals go through incomplete moults.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Moult of Flight Feathers in Darters (Anhingidae)|author=Ryan, Peter G.|journal=Ardea|volume=101|issue=4|pages=177–180|year=2014| doi=10.5253/078.101.0213|s2cid=86476224}}</ref>\n\n=== Predation ===\n[[Predator]]s of darters are mainly large [[carnivorous]] birds, including [[passerines]] like the [[Australian raven]] (\'\'Corvus coronoides\'\') and [[house crow]] (\'\'Corvus splendens\'\'), and [[birds of prey]] such as [[marsh harrier]]s (\'\'Circus aeruginosus\'\' complex) or [[Pallas\'s fish eagle]] (\'\'Haliaeetus leucoryphus\'\'). Predation by \'\'[[Crocodylus]]\'\' [[crocodile]]s has also been noted. But many would-be predators know better than to try to catch a darter. The long neck and pointed bill in combination with the "darting" mechanism make the birds dangerous even to larger carnivorous [[mammal]]s, and they will actually move toward an intruder to attack rather than defending passively or fleeing.<ref name = km9609>Kennedy et al. (1996), Myers et al. [2009]</ref>\n\n=== Breeding ===\nThey usually breed in colonies, occasionally mixed with [[cormorant]]s or herons. The darters [[pair bond]] [[monogamous]]ly at least for a breeding season. There are many different types of [[Display (zoology)|displays]] used for mating. Males display to attract females by raising (but not stretching) their wings to wave them in an alternating fashion, bowing and snapping the bill, or giving twigs to potential mates. To strengthen the pair bond, partners rub their bills or wave, point upwards or bow their necks in unison. When one partner comes to relieve the other at the nest, males and females use the same display the male employs during courtship; during changeovers, the birds may also "[[yawn]]" at each other.<ref name = km9609 />\n\nBreeding is seasonal (peaking in March/April) at the northern end of their range; elsewhere they can be found breeding all year round. The [[bird nest|nests]] are made of twigs and lined with leaves; they are built in trees or reeds, usually near water. Typically, the male gathers nesting material and brings it to the female, which does most of the actual construction work. Nest construction takes only a few days (about three at most), and the pairs [[copulation (zoology)|copulate]] at the nest site. The [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] size is two to six [[bird egg|eggs]] (usually about four) which have a pale green color. The eggs are laid within 24–48 hours and [[Avian incubation|incubated]] for 25 to 30 days, starting after the first has been laid; they hatch asynchronously. To provide warmth to the eggs, the parents will cover them with their large webbed feet, because like their relatives they lack a [[brood patch]]. The last young to hatch will usually starve in years with little food available. [[Bi-parental care]] is given and the young are considered [[altricial]]. They are fed by [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]] of partly digested food when young, switching to entire food items as they grow older. After [[fledging]], the young are fed for about two more weeks while they learn to hunt for themselves.<ref>Answers.com [2009], Myers et al. [2009]</ref>\n\nThese birds reach sexual maturity by about two years, and generally live to around nine years. The maximum possible lifespan of darters seems to be about sixteen years.<ref>AnAge [2009], Myers et al. [2009]</ref>\n\nDarter eggs are edible and considered delicious by some; they are locally collected by humans as food. The adults are also eaten occasionally, as they are rather meaty birds (comparable to a [[domestic duck]]); like other fish-eating birds such as cormorants or [[seaduck]]s they do not taste particularly good though. Darter eggs and [[nestling]]s are also collected in a few places to raise the young. Sometimes this is done for food, but some [[nomad]]s in [[Assam]] and [[Bengal]] train tame darters to be employed as in [[cormorant fishing]]. With an increasing number of nomads settling down in recent decades, this [[cultural heritage]] is in danger of being lost. On the other hand, as evidenced by the [[etymology]] of "anhinga" detailed above, the [[Tupi people|Tupi]] seem to have considered the anhinga a kind of bird of ill [[omen]].<ref name = myersetal2009 />\n\n== Systematics and evolution ==\n[[File:Anhinga rufa -Chobe River front, Botswana-8.jpg|upright|thumb|[[African darter]] on the waterfront of the [[Chobe River]], Botswana]]\nThe [[genus]] \'\'Anhinga\'\' was introduced by the French zoologist [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]] in 1760, with the [[anhinga]] or American darter (\'\'Anhinga anhinga\'\') as the [[type species]].<ref>{{ cite book | last=Brisson | first=Mathurin Jacques | author-link=Mathurin Jacques Brisson | year=1760 | title=Ornithologie, ou, Méthode Contenant la Division des Oiseaux en Ordres, Sections, Genres, Especes & leurs Variétés | language=fr, la | at=[https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/36010460 Vol. 1, p. 60], [https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/36211446 Vol. 6, p. 476] | place=Paris | publisher=Jean-Baptiste Bauche }}</ref><ref>{{ cite book | editor1-last=Mayr | editor1-first=Ernst | editor1-link=Ernst Mayr | editor2-last=Cottrell | editor2-first=G.

The name changed to \'\'anhingá\'\' or \'\'anhangá\'\' as it was transferred to the Tupi–[[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] [[Língua Geral]]. However, in its first documented use as an English term in 1818, it referred to an [[Old World]] darter. Ever since, it has also been used for the modern genus \'\'Anhinga\'\' as a whole.<ref>Jobling (1991): p.48, MW [2009]</ref>\n\nThis family is very closely related to the other [[family (biology)|families]] in the [[suborder]] [[Sulae]], i.e. the [[Phalacrocoracidae]] (cormorants and shags) and the [[Sulidae]] (gannets and boobies). Cormorants and darters are extremely similar as regards their body and leg [[skeleton]]s and may be [[sister taxa]]. In fact, several darter [[fossil]]s were initially believed to be cormorants or shags (see below). Some earlier authors included the darters in the Phalacrocoracidae as [[subfamily]] Anhingina, but this is nowadays generally considered [[lumpers and splitters|overlumping]]. However, as this agrees quite well with the fossil evidence,<ref>E.g. genera like \'\'[[Borvocarbo]]\'\', \'\'[[Limicorallus]]\'\' or \'\'[[Piscator (bird)|Piscator]]\'\': Mayr (2009): pp.65–67</ref> some unite the Anhingidae and Phalacrocoracidae in a [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] [[Phalacrocoracoidea]].<ref>Brodkorb & Mourer-Chauviré (1982), Olson (1985): p.207, Becker (1986), Christidis & Boles (2008): p.100, Mayr (2009): pp.67–70, Myers et al. [2009]</ref>\n\nThe Sulae are also united by their characteristic [[display (zoology)|display]] behavior, which agrees with the [[phylogeny]] as laid out by [[anatomical]] and [[DNA sequence]] data. While the darters\' lack of many display behaviors is shared with gannets (and that of a few with cormorants), these are all [[symplesiomorph]]ies that are absent in [[frigatebird]]s, [[tropicbird]]s and [[pelican]]s also. Like cormorants but unlike other birds, darters use their [[hyoid bone]] to stretch the [[gular sac]] in display. Whether the pointing display of mates is another [[synapomorphy]] of darters and cormorants that was dropped again in some of the latter, or whether it evolved independently in darters and those cormorants that do it, is not clear. The male raised-wing display seems to be a synapomorphy of the Sulae; like almost all cormorants and shags but unlike almost all gannets and boobies, darters keep their [[wrist]]s bent as they lift the wings in display, but their alternating wing-waving, which they also show before take-off, is unique. That they often balance with their outstretched wings during walking is probably an [[autapomorph]]y of darters, necessitated by their being plumper than the other Sulae.<ref>Kennedy \'\'et al.\'\' (1996)</ref>\n\nThe Sulae were traditionally included in the [[Pelecaniformes]], then a [[paraphyletic]] group of "[[higher waterbird]]s". The supposed traits uniting them, like all-webbed toes and a bare gular sac, are now known to be [[convergent evolution|convergent]], and pelicans are apparently closer relatives of [[stork]]s than of the Sulae. Hence, the Sulae and the frigatebirds – and some [[prehistoric]] relatives – are increasingly separated as the [[Suliformes]], which is sometimes dubbed "Phalacrocoraciformes".<ref>Christidis & Boles (2008): p.100, Anwers.com [2009], Mayr (2009): pp.67–70, Myers et al.

But these are actually misidentified bones of the [[long-tailed cormorant]] (\'\'Microcarbo/Phalacrocorax africanus\'\') and the [[little pied cormorant]] (\'\'M./P. melanoleucos\'\'), respectively. In the former case, however, the remains are larger than those of the geographically closest extant population of long-tailed cormorants on [[Madagascar]]: they thus might belong to an extinct subspecies (Mauritian cormorant), which would have to be called \'\'Microcarbo africanus nanus\'\' (or \'\'Phalacrocorax a. nanus\'\') – quite ironically, as the [[Latin]] term \'\'nanus\'\' means dwarf. The [[Late Pleistocene]] \'\'Anhinga laticeps\'\' is not specifically distinct from the Australasian darter; it might have been a large [[paleosubspecies]] of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]].<ref>Miller (1966), Olson (1975), Brodkorb & Mourer-Chauviré (1982), Olson (1985): p.206, Mackness (1995)</ref>\n\n=== Fossil record ===\n[[File:AnhingaSmit.jpg|thumb|upright|Spine, tendons and musculature of the neck showing the elongated vertebrae (3-8) that enables the darting movements.

The other families placed in the [[Phalacrocoraciformes]] sequentially appear throughout the [[Eocene]], the most distinct – frigatebirds – being known since almost 50 Ma ([[million years ago]]) and probably of [[Paleocene]] origin. With fossil gannets being known since the mid-Eocene (c. 40 Ma) and fossil cormorants appearing soon thereafter, the origin of the darters as a distinct lineage was presumably around 50–40 Ma, maybe a bit earlier.<ref>Becker (1986), Mayr (2009): pp.67–70</ref>\n\nFossil Anhingidae are known since the [[Early Miocene]]; a number of [[prehistoric]] darters similar to those still alive have been described, as well as some more distinct genera now [[extinct]]. The diversity was highest in [[South America]], and thus it is likely that the family originated there. Some of the genera which ultimately became extinct were very large, and a tendency to become [[flightless birds|flightless]] has been noted in prehistoric darters. Their distinctness has been doubted, but this was due to the supposed \'\'"Anhinga" fraileyi\'\' being rather similar to \'\'Macranhinga\'\', rather than due to them resembling the living species:<ref>Cione \'\'et al.\'\' (2000), Alvarenga & Guilherme (2003)</ref>\n* \'\'[[Meganhinga]]\'\' <small>Alvarenga, 1995</small> (Early Miocene of Chile)<!-- NaturalHistoryMuseumOfLosAngelesCountyContributionsInScience460:1. -->\n* "[[Paranavis]]" (Middle/Late Miocene of Paraná, Argentina) – a \'\'[[nomen nudum]]\'\'<ref>Named in a [[thesis]] and hence not validly according to [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] rules.
