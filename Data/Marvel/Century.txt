Centuries are numbered [[names of numbers in English#Ordinal numbers|ordinally]] in English and many other languages. The word \'\'century\'\' comes from the [[Latin]] \'\'centum\'\', meaning \'\'one hundred\'\'.  \'\'Century\'\' is sometimes abbreviated as \'\'\'c.\'\'\'<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/how-to-use-the-oed/abbreviations/|title = Oxford English Dictionary – List of Abbreviations}}</ref>\n\nA [[centennial]] or centenary is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.\n\n== Start and end of centuries ==\nAlthough a century can mean any arbitrary period of 100 [[years]], there are two viewpoints on the nature of standard centuries. One is based on strict construction, while the other is based on popular perception.  \n\nAccording to the strict construction, the 1st century [[AD]] began with AD 1 and ended with AD 100, the 2nd century spanning the years 101 to 200, with the same pattern continuing onward.{{NoteTag|[[AD]] and [[Common Era|CE]] year numbering, which are numerically equivalent, are now commonly used to number years, including those which occurred before these notations were invented; AD did not become widespread in Europe until early in the 2nd millennium.}} In this model, the \'\'n\'\'-th century starts with the year that ends with "01", and ends with the year that ends with "00"; for example, the 20th century comprises the years \'\'\'1901\'\'\' to \'\'\'2000\'\'\' in strict usage.<ref>{{cite web |title=When Did the 21st Century Start? |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/counters/mil2000.html#:~:text=The%2021st%20Century%20Started%20in%202001&text=The%20year%20number%20in%20the,BC%2C%3A%20What\'s%20the%20difference%3F |website=timeanddate.com |access-date=23 November 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn popular perception and practice, centuries are structured by grouping years based on sharing the \'hundreds\' digit(s). In this model, the \'\'n\'\'-th century starts with the year that ends in "00" and ends with the year ending in "99";<ref>{{Cite web| title = century | work = Oxford Dictionaries| access-date = 20 January 2021| url = https://www.lexico.com/definition/century| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191230065254/https://www.lexico.com/definition/century| url-status = dead| archive-date = December 30, 2019}}</ref> for example, the years \'\'\'1900\'\'\' to \'\'\'1999\'\'\', in [[popular culture]], constitute the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Centuries and How to Refer to Them | work = Merriam-Webster| access-date = 27 April 2021 | url = https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/centuries-and-how-to-refer-to-them}}</ref> (This is similar to the grouping of [[Decade#0-to-9 decade|"0-to-9 decades"]] which share the \'tens\' digit.) \n\nTo facilitate calendrical calculations by computer, the [[astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] systems both contain a [[year zero]], with the astronomical year 0 corresponding to the year 1 BCE, the astronomical year -1 corresponding to 2 BCE, and so on.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Calendars | work = L.E.

In this system, the years 1900–1999 are referred to as the \'\'nineteen hundreds\'\' (\'\'1900s\'\'). Aside from English usage, this system is used in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. The Swedish \'\'nittonhundratalet\'\' (or \'\'1900-talet\'\'), Danish \'\'nittenhundredetallet\'\' (or \'\'1900-tallet\'\'), Norwegian \'\'nittenhundretallet\'\' (or \'\' 1900-tallet\'\'), Finnish \'\'tuhatyhdeksänsataaluku\'\' (or \'\'1900-luku\'\') and Hungarian \'\'ezerkilencszázas évek\'\' (or \'\'1900-as évek\'\') refer unambiguously to the years 1900–1999.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] also has a similar system, but it only expresses the hundreds and omits the word for “thousand”. This system mainly functions from the 11th to the 20th century: \n:\'\'il [[Quattrocento]]\'\' (that is “the four hundred”, the 15th century)\n:\'\'il [[Cinquecento]]\'\' (that is “the five hundred”, the 16th century). \nThese terms are often used in other languages when referring to the [[history of Italy]].\n\n== Similar dating units in other calendar systems ==\nWhile the century has been commonly used in the West, other cultures and calendars have utilized differently sized groups of years in a similar manner. The [[Hindu calendar]], in particular, summarizes its years into groups of 60,<ref>{{cite web|title=www.vedavidyalaya.com|url=http://www.vedavidyalaya.com/varsham.htm|access-date=4 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217233346/http://www.vedavidyalaya.com/varsham.htm|archive-date=17 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> while the [[Aztec calendar]] considers groups of 52.<ref>{{cite web|title=www.aztec-history.com|url=http://www.aztec-history.com/aztec-calendar.html|access-date=4 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary|century}}\n{{Commons category multi|Centuries|Centennials}}\n* [[Age of Discovery]]\n* [[Ancient history]]\n* [[Before Christ]]\n* [[Common Era]]\n* [[Decade]]\n* [[List of decades, centuries, and millennia]]\n* [[Lustrum]]\n* [[Middle Ages]]\n* [[Millennium]]\n* [[Modern era]]\n* [[Saeculum]]\n* [[Year]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* [ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/reference.guides/battle.centuries.txt \'\'The Battle of the Centuries\'\'], [[Ruth Freitag]], [[U.S. Government Printing Office]].
