Tactics and weapons used can include [[attack dog]]s, [[water cannon]]s, [[plastic bullet]]s, [[rubber bullet]]s, [[pepper spray]], [[flexible baton round]]s, and [[snatch squad]]s. Many police forces have dedicated divisions to deal with public order situations. Some examples are the [[Territorial Support Group]] ([[London]]), [[Special Patrol Group]] ([[London]]), [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité]] ([[France]]), [[Mobiele Eenheid]] ([[Netherlands]]), and [[Arrest unit]]s ([[Germany]]).\n[[File:Wasserwerfer.jpg|thumb|right|Water cannon during a riot in Germany, 2001]]\nThe policing of riots has been marred by incidents in which police have been accused of provoking rioting or crowd violence. While the weapons described above are officially designated as [[non-lethal]], a number of people have died or been injured as a result of their use.
