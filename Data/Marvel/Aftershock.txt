Large earthquakes can have hundreds to thousands of instrumentally detectable aftershocks, which steadily decrease in magnitude and frequency according to [[#Aftershock size and frequency with time|a consistent pattern]]. In some earthquakes the main rupture happens in two or more steps, resulting in multiple main shocks. These are known as [[doublet earthquake]]s, and in general can be distinguished from aftershocks in having similar magnitudes and nearly identical seismic [[waveform]]s.\n\n==Distribution of aftershocks==\n[[Image:Sichuan 2008 Aftershocks.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n[[Image:Neic slav fig72.gif|thumb|left|250px]]\nMost aftershocks are located over the full area of fault rupture and either occur along the fault plane itself or along other faults within the volume affected by the strain associated with the main shock. Typically, aftershocks are found up to a distance equal to the rupture length away from the fault plane.\n\nThe pattern of aftershocks helps confirm the size of area that slipped during the main shock. In the case of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] the aftershock distribution shows in both cases that the [[epicenter]] (where the rupture initiated) lies to one end of the final area of slip, implying strongly asymmetric rupture propagation.\n\n==Aftershock size and frequency with time==\nAftershocks rates and magnitudes follow several well-established empirical laws.\n\n===Omori\'s law {{anchor|Omori\'s Law}}===\nThe frequency of aftershocks decreases roughly with the reciprocal of time after the main shock.  This empirical relation was first described by [[Fusakichi Omori]] in 1894 and is known as Omori\'s law.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Omori | first1 = F. | year = 1894 | title = On the aftershocks of earthquakes | journal = Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo | volume = 7 | url = http://repository.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2261/28944/1/jcs702001.pdf | pages = 111–200 | access-date = 2015-07-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150716020716/http://repository.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2261/28944/1/jcs702001.pdf | archive-date = 2015-07-16 | url-status = dead }}</ref>  It is expressed as\n\n: <math>n(t) = \\frac {k} {(c+t)}</math>\n\nwhere \'\'k\'\' and \'\'c\'\' are constants, which vary between earthquake sequences.  A modified version of Omori\'s law, now commonly used, was proposed by [[Tokuji Utsu|Utsu]] in 1961.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Utsu | first1 = T. | year = 1961 | title = A statistical study of the occurrence of aftershocks | journal = Geophysical Magazine | volume = 30 | pages = 521–605 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Utsu |first1=T. |last2=Ogata |first2=Y. |last3=Matsu\'ura |first3=R.S. |year=1995 |title=The centenary of the Omori formula for a decay law of aftershock activity |journal=Journal of Physics of the Earth |volume=43 |pages=1–33 |doi=10.4294/jpe1952.43.1 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n: <math>n(t) = \\frac {k} {(c+t)^p}</math>\n\nwhere \'\'p\'\' is a third constant which modifies the decay rate and typically falls in the range 0.7–1.5.\n\nAccording to these equations, the rate of aftershocks decreases quickly with time. The rate of aftershocks is proportional to the inverse of time since the mainshock and this relationship can be used to estimate the probability of future aftershock occurrence.<ref name="Quigley">{{cite web|url=http://www.chcheqjournal.com/2011/science-update-2011-christchurch-earthquake-press-public-seismic-fear-mongering-time-jump-ship/ |title=New Science update on 2011 Christchurch Earthquake for press and public: Seismic fearmongering or time to jump ship |last=Quigley |first=M. |work=Christchurch Earthquake Journal |access-date=25 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129200558/http://www.chcheqjournal.com/2011/science-update-2011-christchurch-earthquake-press-public-seismic-fear-mongering-time-jump-ship/ |archive-date=29 January 2012 }}</ref> Thus whatever the probability of an aftershock are on the first day, the second day will have 1/2 the probability of the first day and the tenth day will have approximately 1/10 the probability of the first day (when \'\'p\'\' is equal to 1). These patterns describe only the statistical behavior of aftershocks; the actual times, numbers and locations of the aftershocks are [[stochastic]], while tending to follow these patterns. As this is an empirical law, values of the parameters are obtained by fitting to data after a mainshock has occurred, and they imply no specific physical mechanism in any given case.\n\nThe Utsu-Omori law has also been obtained theoretically, as\nthe solution of a differential equation describing the evolution of the aftershock activity,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1134/S1069351316050165 | last1 = Guglielmi | first1 =  A.V. | year = 2016 | title = Interpretation of the Omori law | journal =  Izvestiya, Physics of the Solid Earth| volume = 52 | issue = 5| pages = 785–786 | arxiv = 1604.07017 | bibcode = 2016IzPSE..52..785G | s2cid = 119256791 }}</ref> where the interpretation of the evolution equation is based on the idea of deactivation of the faults in the vicinity of the main shock of the earthquake.

Bigger earthquakes have more and larger aftershocks and the sequences can last for years or even longer especially when a large event occurs in a seismically quiet area; see, for example, the [[New Madrid Seismic Zone]], where events still follow Omori\'s law from the main shocks of 1811–1812. An aftershock sequence is deemed to have ended when the rate of seismicity drops back to a background level; i.e., no further decay in the number of events with time can be detected.\n\nLand movement around the New Madrid is reported to be no more than {{convert|0.2|mm|abbr=on}} a year,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.physorg.com/news156169464.html |title= New Madrid fault system may be shutting down |publisher= physorg.com |date=2009-03-13 |author = Elizabeth K.
