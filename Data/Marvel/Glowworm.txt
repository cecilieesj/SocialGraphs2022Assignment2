They include the European [[Lampyris noctiluca|common glow-worm]] and other members of the [[Lampyridae]], but bioluminescence also occurs in the families [[Elateridae]], [[Phengodidae]] and [[Rhagophthalmidae]] among [[beetle]]s; as well as members of the genera [[Arachnocampa]], [[Keroplatus]] and [[Orfelia]] among [[Keroplatidae|keroplatid]] [[fungi’s gnat]]s.\n\n==Beetles==\nFour families of beetles are [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]]. The wingless [[larviform female]]s and larvae of these bioluminescent species are usually known as "glowworms". Winged males may or may not also exhibit bioluminescence. Their light may be emitted as flashes or as a constant glow, and usually range in colour from green, yellow, to orange.<ref name="pso"/> The families are closely related, and are all members of the beetle superfamily, [[Elateroidea]]. Phylogenetic analyses have indicated that bioluminescence may have a single evolutionary origin among the families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, and Rhagophthalmidae; but is likely to have arisen independently among Elateridae.<ref name="oba">{{cite book|author=Yuichi Oba|editor =Klaus H.

Of the estimated 10,000 species classified under this family, around 200 species from tropical regions of the Americas and some [[Melanesia]]n islands are bioluminescent. All of them are members of the subfamily Pyrophorinae, except for one species, \'\'[[Campyloxenus pyrothorax]]\'\', which belongs to subfamily Campyloxeninae, and \'\'[[Balgus schnusei]]\'\', in [[Thylacosterninae]].<ref>Costa, C.

The validity of this family has not been fully resolved. Rhagophthalmidae was formerly considered to be a subfamily under Phengodidae before being treated as a distinct family. Some authors{{who|date=November 2021}} now believe that it should be classified under Lampyridae.\n{{Gallery\n|File:Glowworm (4213020277).jpg|[[Phengodidae]]: Larva or [[larviform female]] of the western banded glowworm (\'\'[[Zarhipis integripennis|Zarhipis&nbsp;integripennis]]\'\') \n|File:Firefly Nevit 02670 cr.jpg|[[Lampyridae]]: Female common glowworm (\'\'[[Lampyris noctiluca|Lampyris&nbsp;noctiluca]]\'\') from [[Assos]], [[Turkey]]\n|File:Photinus pyralis Firefly 3.jpg|[[Lampyridae]]: Male common eastern firefly (\'\'[[Photinus pyralis|Photinus&nbsp;pyralis]]\'\') from [[Evansville, Indiana]]\n|File:Pyrophorus noctilucus click beetle.jpg|[[Elateridae]]: Male headlight click beetle (\'\'[[Pyrophorus noctilucus|Pyrophorus&nbsp;noctilucus]]\'\') from [[Jamaica]]\n}}\n\n==Fungus gnats==\nThree genera of [[fungus gnat]]s are bioluminescent, and known as "glowworms" in their larval stage. They produce a blue-green light.<ref name="pso"/> The larvae spin sticky webs to catch food. They are found in caves, overhangs, rock cavities, and other sheltered, wet areas. They are usually classified under the family [[Keroplatidae]], but this is not universally accepted and some authors place them under [[Mycetophilidae]] instead. Despite the similarities in function and appearance, the bioluminescent systems of the three genera are not [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] and are believed to have evolved separately.<ref name="oba"/><ref name="V">{{cite journal |first1=Vadim R. |last1=Viviani |first2=J.
