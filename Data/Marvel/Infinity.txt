Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (which leads to the one exception that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables [[division by zero]], namely <math>z/0 = \\infty</math> for any nonzero complex number&nbsp;\'\'<math>z</math>\'\'. In this context, it is often useful to consider [[meromorphic function]]s as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of <math>\\infty</math> at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s (see [[Möbius transformation#Overview|Möbius transformation § Overview]]).\n\n===Nonstandard analysis===\n[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinities (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)]]\n\nThe original formulation of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and Gottfried Leibniz used [[infinitesimal]] quantities. In the second half of the 20th century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various [[logical system]]s, including [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] and [[nonstandard analysis]]. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]]; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian [[transfinite number|transfinites]]. For example, if&nbsp;H is an infinite number in this sense, then H&nbsp;+&nbsp;H&nbsp;=&nbsp;2H and H&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to [[non-standard calculus]] is fully developed in {{harvtxt|Keisler|1986}}.\n\n===Set theory===\n{{Main|Cardinality|Ordinal number}}\n\n[[File:Infinity paradoxon - one-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset.gif|thumb|One-to-one correspondence between an infinite set and its proper subset]]\n\nA different form of "infinity" are the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] and [[cardinal number|cardinal]] infinities of set theory—a system of [[transfinite number]]s first developed by [[Georg Cantor]]. In this system, the first transfinite cardinal is [[aleph-null]] (<span style="font-family:\'Cambria Math\';"><big>ℵ</big><sub>0</sub></span>), the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late 19th century from works by Cantor, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others—using the idea of collections or sets.<ref name=":1" />\n\nDedekind\'s approach was essentially to adopt the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]] as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (derived from [[Euclid]]) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. (However, see [[Galileo\'s paradox]] where Galileo concludes that positive integers cannot be compared to the subset of positive [[Square number|square integers]] since both are infinite sets.) An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its [[proper subset|proper]] parts; this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. The diagram to the right gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. "size".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nCantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: [[ordinal number]]s and [[cardinal number]]s. Ordinal numbers characterize [[well-ordered]] sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and (ordinary) infinite [[sequence]]s which are maps from the positive [[integers]] leads to [[Function (mathematics)|mappings]] from ordinal numbers to transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is [[countable set|countably infinite]]. If a set is too large to be put in one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called \'\'[[Uncountable set|uncountable]]\'\'. Cantor\'s views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity as part of a consistent and coherent theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.dartmouth.edu/~matc/Readers/HowManyAngels/InfinityMind/IM.html|title=Infinity|website=math.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Infinite\n|first1=A.W.\n|last1=Moore\n|publisher=Routledge\n|year=1991}}\n</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2014}}  Certain extended number systems, such as the hyperreal numbers, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Cardinality of the continuum====\n{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}\n\nOne of Cantor\'s most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum <math>\\mathbf c</math> is greater than that of the natural numbers <math>{\\aleph_0}</math>; that is, there are more real numbers {{math|\'\'\'R\'\'\'}} than natural numbers {{math|\'\'\'N\'\'\'}}.

These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|1994|pp=10–12}}</ref>\n\n===Geometry===\n\nUntil the end of the 19th century, infinity was rarely discussed in [[geometry]], except in the context of processes that could be continued without any limit. For example, a [[line (geometry)|line]] was what is now called a [[line segment]], with the proviso that one can extend it as far as one wants; but extending it \'\'infinitely\'\' was out of the question. Similarly, a line was usually not considered to be composed of infinitely many points, but was a location where a point may be placed. Even if there are infinitely many possible positions, only a finite number of points could be placed on a line. A witness of this is the expression "the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of \'\'a point\'\' that satisfies some property" (singular), where modern mathematicians would generally say "the set of \'\'the points\'\' that have the property" (plural).\n\nOne of the rare exceptions of a mathematical concept involving [[actual infinity]] was [[projective geometry]], where [[points at infinity]] are added to the [[Euclidean space]] for modeling the [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] effect that shows [[parallel lines]] intersecting "at infinity". Mathematically, points at infinity have the advantage of allowing one to not consider some special cases. For example, in a [[projective plane]], two distinct [[line (geometry)|lines]] intersect in exactly one point, whereas without points at infinity, there are no intersection points for parallel lines. So, parallel and non-parallel lines must be studied separately in classical geometry, while they need not to be distinguished in projective geometry.\n\nBefore the use of [[set theory]] for the [[foundation of mathematics]], points and lines were viewed as distinct entities, and a point could be \'\'located on a line\'\'. With the universal use of set theory in mathematics, the point of view has dramatically changed: a line is now considered as \'\'the set of its points\'\', and one says that a point \'\'belongs to a line\'\' instead of \'\'is located on a line\'\' (however, the latter phrase is still used).\n\nIn particular, in modern mathematics, lines are \'\'infinite sets\'\'.\n\n===Infinite dimension===\nThe [[vector space]]s that occur in classical [[geometry]] have always a finite [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]], generally two or three. However, this is not implied by the abstract definition of a vector space, and vector spaces of infinite dimension can be considered. This is typically the case in [[functional analysis]] where [[function space]]s are generally vector spaces of infinite dimension.\n\nIn topology, some constructions can generate [[topological space]]s of infinite dimension. In particular, this is the case of [[iterated loop space]]s.\n\n===Fractals===\nThe structure of a [[fractal]] object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming "smooth"; they have infinite perimeters, and can have infinite or finite areas. One such [[fractal curve]] with an infinite perimeter and finite area is the [[Koch snowflake]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Mathematics without infinity===\n[[Leopold Kronecker]] was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] called [[finitism]], an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of [[Mathematical constructivism|constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=1197–1198}}</ref>\n\n==Physics==\n\nIn [[physics]], approximations of [[real number]]s are used for [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] measurements and [[natural number]]s are used for [[countable|discrete]] measurements (i.e., counting). Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite [[plane wave]] exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.<ref>[http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf Doric Lenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124011604/http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }} – Application Note – Axicons – 2.

The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth\'s curvature, one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar [[topology]].
