He had once before put Zeus to sleep at the bidding of Hera, allowing her to cause [[Heracles]] (who was returning by sea from [[Laomedon]]\'s Troy) great misfortune. Zeus was furious and would have smote Hypnos into the sea if he had not fled to Nyx, his mother, in fear. Homer goes on to say that Zeus, fearing Nyx\'s anger, held his fury at bay and in this way Hypnos escaped the wrath of Zeus by appealing to his powerful mother. He disturbed Zeus only a few times after that, always fearing Zeus and running back to his mother, Nyx, who would have confronted Zeus with a maternal fury.\n\n=== Others ===\nIn several fragmentary poems attributed to [[Orpheus]] Nyx, rather than Chaos, is the first principle from which all creation emerges.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Nyx occupies a cave or [[adyton]], in which she gives [[oracle]]s. [[Cronus]] – who is chained within, asleep and drunk on honey – dreams and prophesies. Outside the cave, [[Adrasteia]] clashes cymbals and beats upon her [[Timpani|tympanon]], moving the entire universe in an ecstatic dance to the rhythm of Nyx\'s chanting. [[Phanes]] – the strange, monstrous, [[hermaphrodite]] Orphic [[demiurge]] – was the child{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} or father of Nyx. Nyx is also the first principle in the opening chorus of [[Aristophanes]]\' \'\'[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]\'\', which may be Orphic in inspiration. Here she is also the mother of [[Eros]].<ref>[[Aristophanes]], \'\'[[The Birds (play)|Birds]]\'\' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristoph.+Birds+693&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0026 693&ndash;698]; Smith, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DN%3Aentry+group%3D13%3Aentry%3Dnyx-bio-1 s.v. Nyx].</ref>\n\nThe theme of Nyx\'s cave or mansion, beyond the ocean (as in Hesiod) or somewhere at the edge of the [[universe|cosmos]] (as in later Orphism) may be echoed in the philosophical poem of [[Parmenides]]. The classical scholar [[Walter Burkert]] has speculated that the house of the goddess to which the philosopher is transported is the palace of Nyx.\n\nIn [[Virgil]]\'s \'\'[[Aeneid]]\'\', Nox (Night) is said to be the mother of the [[Erinyes|Furies]] by [[Pluto]].<ref>[[Virgil]], \'\'[[Aeneid]]\'\' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Aphi%2C0690%2C003%3A7%3A339 6.250] (mother of the "Eumenides" another name for the Furies),  [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D323 7.323&ndash;330] (Allecto a daughter of Pluto and Night), [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0054:book=12:card=843 12.845&ndash;846] (Night mother of the Furies).</ref> \n\nIn some accounts, the goddess of witchcraft, [[Hecate]], was also called the daughter of Night.<ref>[[Scholia|Scholiast]] on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], \'\'[[Argonautica]]\'\' 3.467 with the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic hymns]] as the authority.</ref>\n\nSome authors made Nyx the mother of [[Eos]], the [[Dawn deity|dawn goddess]], who was often conflated with Nyx\'s daughter Hemera.<ref>[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], [https://archive.org/details/falloftroy00quin/page/112/mode/2up?view=theater 2.625–26]; cf.

According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], she had an oracle on the acropolis at [[Megara]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.40.1 1.40.1]</ref> Pausanias wrote:\n\n{{quote|When you have ascended the citadel [of Megara], which even at the present day is called Karia (Caria) from Kar (Car), son of [[Phoroneus]], you see a temple of Dionysos Nyktelios (Nyctelius, Nocturnal), a sanctuary built to Aphrodite Epistrophia (She who turns men to love), an oracle called that of Nyx (Night) and a temple of Zeus Konios (Cronius, Dusty) without a roof.<ref>Pausanias, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.40.6 1.40.6]</ref>}}\n\nMore often, Nyx was worshipped in the background of other cults.

[[Ovid]] wrote: "May 9 Lemuria Nefastus. You ancient rite will be performed, Nox Lemuria; here will be offerings to the mute dead",<ref>[[Ovid]], \'\'[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]\'\' 5.421–422 (trans.Boyle)</ref> and she is also mentioned by [[Statius]]: \n\n{{quote|O Nox . . .

Mozley)</ref>}}\n\n==Astronomy==\nIn 1997, the [[International Astronomical Union]] approved the name Nyx for a [[List of montes on Venus|mons (mountain/peak)]] feature on the planet [[Venus]]. Nyx Mons is located at [[latitude]] 30° North and [[longitude]] 48.5° East on the Venusian surface. Its diameter is 875 km.\n\nOn June 21, 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] renamed one of [[Pluto]]\'s recently discovered moons (S/2005 P 2) [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], in honor of Nyx. The name was spelled with an "i" instead of a "y", to avoid conflict with the [[asteroid]] [[3908 Nyx]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Aristophanes]], \'\'Birds\'\'. \'\'The Complete Greek Drama.\'\' \'\'vol. 2\'\'.
