Protons and neutrons are not [[elementary particle]]s; each is composed of three [[quark]]s. \n \nThe [[chemical properties]] of an atom are mostly determined by the configuration of [[electron]]s that orbit the atom\'s heavy nucleus. The electron configuration is determined by the charge of the nucleus, which is determined by the number of protons, or [[atomic number]]. The number of neutrons is the [[neutron number]]. Neutrons do not affect the electron configuration, but the sum of atomic and neutron numbers is the mass of the nucleus.\n\nAtoms of a [[chemical element]] that differ only in neutron number are called [[isotopes]]. For example, [[carbon]], with atomic number 6, has an abundant isotope [[carbon-12]] with 6 neutrons and a rare isotope [[carbon-13]] with 7 neutrons.  Some elements occur in nature with only one [[stable nuclide|stable isotope]], such as [[fluorine]]; Other elements occur with many stable isotopes, such as [[tin]] with ten stable isotopes, and some elements such as [[technetium]] have no stable isotope.\n\nThe properties of an atomic nucleus depend on both atomic and neutron numbers. With their positive charge, the protons within the nucleus are repelled by the long-range [[electromagnetic force]], but the much stronger, but short-range, [[nuclear force]] binds the nucleons closely together. Neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei, with the exception of the single-proton [[hydrogen]] nucleus. Neutrons are produced copiously in [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]]. They are a primary contributor to the [[nucleosynthesis]] of chemical elements within [[star]]s through fission, fusion, and [[neutron capture]] processes.\n\nThe neutron is essential to the production of nuclear power.

The free proton is stable. However, neutrons or protons bound in a nucleus can be stable or unstable, depending on the [[nuclide]]. Beta decay, in which neutrons decay to protons, or vice versa, is governed by the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and it requires the emission or absorption of electrons and neutrinos, or their antiparticles.\n\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|150px|right|Nuclear fission caused by absorption of a neutron by uranium-235. The heavy nuclide fragments into lighter components and additional neutrons.]]\nProtons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the nuclear force within the nucleus. The concept of [[isospin]], in which the proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle, is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces. Because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances, the [[binding energy]] of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms. [[Nuclear reaction]]s (such as [[nuclear fission]]) therefore have an [[energy density]] that is more than ten million times that of [[chemical reaction]]s. Because of the [[mass–energy equivalence]], nuclear binding energies reduce the mass of nuclei. Ultimately, the ability of the nuclear force to store energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs possible. In nuclear fission, the absorption of a neutron by a heavy nuclide (e.g., [[uranium-235]]) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break into light nuclides and additional neutrons. The positively charged light nuclides then repel, releasing electromagnetic [[potential energy]].\n\nThe neutron is classified as a \'\'[[hadron]]\'\', because it is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s. The neutron is also classified as a \'\'[[baryon]]\'\', because it is composed of three [[valence quark]]s.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author=Adair, R.K.\n|year=1989\n|title=The Great Design: Particles, Fields, and Creation\n|page=214\n|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|bibcode=1988gdpf.book.....A\n}}</ref> The finite size of the neutron and its magnetic moment both indicate that the neutron is a [[composite particle|composite]], rather than [[elementary particle|elementary]], particle.

Protons can decay to neutrons, or vice versa, within the nucleus.  This process, called [[beta decay]], requires the emission of an electron or [[positron]] and an associated [[neutrino]].  These emitted particles carry away the energy excess as a nucleon falls from one quantum state to a lower energy state, while the proton (or neutron) changes to a neutron (or proton). Such decay processes can occur only if allowed by basic energy conservation and quantum mechanical constraints.  The stability of nuclei depends on these constraints.\n\n===Free neutron decay===\n{{main|Free neutron decay}}\nOutside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a [[mean lifetime]] of {{val|879.6|0.8|u=s}} (about 14 minutes, 40 seconds); therefore the [[half-life]] for this process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of {{math|[[Natural logarithm|ln]](2) {{=}} 0.693}}) is {{val|610.1|0.7|u=s}} (about 10 minutes, 10 seconds).<ref name="RPP" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tanabashi |first1=M. |title=The Review of Particle Physics |journal=Physical Review D |date=2018 |volume=54 |issue=1 |page=1653 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.54.1 |pmid=10020536 |url=https://pdglive.lbl.gov/DataBlock.action?node=S017T |access-date=2020-10-14 |archive-date=2020-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201019234945/https://pdglive.lbl.gov/DataBlock.action?node=S017T |url-status=live }}</ref> This decay is only possible because the mass of the proton is less than that of the neutron.

Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons (as discussed below).\n[[File:Beta-minus Decay.svg|thumb|360px |A [[schematic]] of the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus of an atom]] indicating {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} radiation, the emission of a fast electron from the nucleus (the accompanying antineutrino is omitted). In the Rutherford model for the nucleus, red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge.<br>\nThe \'\'\'inset\'\'\' shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process.]]\nA very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called "two-body (neutron) decays", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the {{val|13.6|ul=eV}} necessary energy to escape the proton (the [[ionization energy]] of [[hydrogen]]), and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral [[hydrogen atom]] (one of the "two bodies"). In this type of free neutron decay, almost all of the neutron [[decay energy]] is carried off by the antineutrino (the other "body"). (The hydrogen atom recoils with a speed of only about (decay energy)/(hydrogen rest energy) times the speed of light, or {{val|250|ul=km/s}}.)\n\nThe transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton. But a high-energy collision of a proton and an electron or neutrino can result in a neutron.\n\n===Bound neutron decay===\n{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}\nWhile a free neutron has a half life of about {{val|10.2|u=min}}, most neutrons within nuclei are stable. According to the [[nuclear shell model]], the protons and neutrons of a [[nuclide]] are a [[introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical system]] organized into discrete [[energy level]]s with unique [[quantum numbers]]. For a neutron to decay, the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled, meaning they are each occupied by two protons with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] up and spin down. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] therefore disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei. The situation is similar to electrons of an atom, where electrons have distinct [[atomic orbital]]s and are prevented from decaying to lower energy states, with the emission of a [[photon]], by the exclusion principle.\n\nNeutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by [[beta decay]] as described above. In this case, an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the proton resulting from the decay. One example of this decay is [[carbon-14]] (6 protons, 8 neutrons) that decays to [[nitrogen-14]] (7 protons, 7 neutrons) with a half-life of about {{val|5730|u=years|fmt=commas}}.\n\nInside a nucleus, a proton can transform into a neutron via [[inverse beta decay]], if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the neutron. This transformation occurs by emission of a positron and an electron neutrino:\n:{{math|{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}}}\n\nThe transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also possible through [[electron capture]]:\n:{{math|{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}}}\nPositron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons is also possible, but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the positive nucleus, and quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] when they encounter electrons.\n\n===Competition of beta decay types===\nThree types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope [[copper-64]] (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide is almost equally likely to undergo proton decay (by [[positron emission]], 18% or by [[electron capture]], 43%) or neutron decay (by electron emission, 39%).\n\n==Decay of the neutron by elementary particle physics==\n[[File:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|200px|The [[Feynman diagram]] for beta decay of a neutron into a proton, electron, and [[electron antineutrino]] via an intermediate heavy [[W boson]]]]\n\nWithin the theoretical framework of [[Standard Model]] for particle physics, the neutron is composed of two down quarks and an up quark. The only possible decay mode for the neutron that [[conservation law|conserves]] [[baryon number]] is for one of the neutron\'s quarks to [[flavour changing processes|change]] [[flavour (physics)|flavour]] via the [[weak interaction]]. The decay of one of the neutron\'s down quarks into a lighter up quark can be achieved by the emission of a [[W boson]]. By this process, the Standard Model description of beta decay, the neutron decays into a proton (which contains one down and two up quarks), an electron, and an [[electron neutrino|electron antineutrino]].\n\n[[File:Electron Capture Decay.svg|thumb|The leading-order [[Feynman diagram]] for {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}&nbsp;decay of a proton into a neutron, positron, and [[electron neutrino]] via an intermediate [[W boson|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}} boson]].]]\n\nThe decay of the proton to a neutron occurs similarly through the electroweak force. The decay of one of the proton\'s up quarks into a down quark can be achieved by the emission of a W boson. The proton decays into a neutron, a positron, and an electron neutrino.  This reaction can only occur within an atomic nucleus which has a quantum state at lower energy available for the created neutron.\n\n==Intrinsic properties==\n\n===Mass===\nThe mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by [[mass spectrometry]] since it has no electric charge. But since the masses of a proton and of a [[deuteron]] can be measured with a mass spectrometer, the mass of a neutron can be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass, with the difference being the mass of the neutron plus the [[binding energy]] of deuterium (expressed as a positive emitted energy). The latter can be directly measured by measuring the energy (<math>B_d</math>) of the single {{val|2.224|u=MeV}} gamma photon emitted when a deuteron is formed by a proton capturing a neutron (this is exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons). The small recoil kinetic energy (<math>E_{rd}</math>) of the deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy) must also be accounted for.\n:<math>m_n= m_d - m_p + B_d - E_{rd}</math>\n\nThe energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by X-ray diffraction techniques, as was first done by Bell and Elliot in 1948. The best modern (1986) values for neutron mass by this technique are provided by Greene, et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Greene |first1= GL |display-authors= etal |year= 1986 |title= New determination of the deuteron binding energy and the neutron mass |journal= [[Physical Review Letters]]|volume= 56 |issue= 8|pages= 819–822 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.819 |bibcode=1986PhRvL..56..819G |pmid=10033294}}</ref> These give a neutron mass of:\n:\'\'m\'\'<sub>neutron</sub> = {{val|1.008644904|(14)|ul=Da}}\n\nThe value for the neutron mass in MeV is less accurately known, due to less accuracy in the known conversion of [[Dalton (unit)|Da]] to MeV/\'\'c\'\'<sup>2</sup>:<ref>Byrne, J. \'\'Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter\'\', Dover Publications, Mineola, New York, 2011, {{ISBN|0486482383}}, pp. 18–19</ref>\n:\'\'m\'\'<sub>neutron</sub> = {{val|939.56563|(28)|ul=MeV/c2}}.\n\nAnother method to determine the mass of a neutron starts from the beta decay of the neutron, when the momenta of the resulting proton and electron are measured.\n\n===Electric charge===\nThe total electric charge of the neutron is {{val|0|u=[[elementary charge|\'\'e\'\']]}}.

Neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that is detectable, but the experiments are not as simple to carry out; other means for detecting neutrons, consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic nuclei, are more commonly used. The commonly used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon, mainly [[neutron capture]] or [[elastic scattering]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Ch. 14|title=Radiation Detection and Measurement|author=Knoll, Glenn F.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1979|isbn=978-0471495451|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/radiationdetecti00knol_0}}</ref>\n\n===Neutron detection by neutron capture===\nA common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released from [[neutron capture]] reactions into electrical signals. Certain nuclides have a high neutron capture [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], which is the probability of absorbing a neutron. Upon neutron capture, the compound nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation, for example an alpha particle, which is then detected. The nuclides {{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Lithium|6}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Boron|10}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Uranium|233}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Uranium|235}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Neptunium|237}}, and {{SimpleNuclide|Plutonium|239}} are useful for this purpose. <!-- The following needs correction, errors due to lack of reference: These nuclides are rarely found in nature, but can be accumulated through processes such as isotopic enrichment.\n\nThe cross section for the process of neutron capture is much lower at high energies than at low energies. Therefore, the detection of neutrons by neutron capture requires a preceding slowing down of neutrons. For this purpose, a [[neutron moderator]] is used, typically a thick slab of polyethylene. Neutron detectors using the moderate-and-capture approach cannot measure neutron energy, precise time of arrival, or direction of incidence, because this information is lost during moderation. -->\n\n===Neutron detection by elastic scattering===\nNeutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, causing the struck nucleus to recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can transfer more energy to a light nucleus such as hydrogen or helium than to a heavier nucleus. Detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal. A major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector.

Their half-life is still only about 10 minutes, so they can be obtained only from sources that produce them continuously.\n\n\'\'\'Natural neutron background.\'\'\' A small natural background flux of free neutrons exists everywhere on Earth. In the atmosphere and deep into the ocean, the "neutron background" is caused by [[muon]]s produced by [[cosmic ray]] interaction with the atmosphere. These high-energy muons are capable of penetration to considerable depths in water and soil. There, in striking atomic nuclei, among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus. Within the Earth\'s crust a second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals. The neutron background is not strong enough to be a biological hazard, but it is of importance to very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare events, such as (hypothesized) interactions that might be caused by particles of [[dark matter]].<ref name="NatNeu"/> Recent research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of MeV.<ref name="KohnEbert">{{cite journal |last1=Köhn |first1=C. |last2=Ebert |first2=U. |author2-link=Ute Ebert |title=Calculation of beams of positrons, neutrons and protons associated with terrestrial gamma-ray flashes |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres]] |date=2015 |volume=23 |issue=4 |doi=10.1002/2014JD022229 |pages=1620–1635 |bibcode=2015JGRD..120.1620K |url=https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/23845/23845D.pdf |doi-access=free |access-date=2019-08-25 |archive-date=2019-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223070457/https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/23845/23845D.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Recent research has shown that the fluence of these neutrons lies between 10<sup>−9</sup> and 10<sup>−13</sup> per ms and per m<sup>2</sup> depending on the detection altitude.

Convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides, often beryllium or deuterium, and induced [[nuclear fission]], such as occurs in nuclear reactors. In addition, high-energy nuclear reactions (such as occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions) also produce neutrons from disintegration of target nuclei. Small (tabletop) [[particle accelerator]]s optimized to produce free neutrons in this way, are called [[neutron generator]]s.\n\nIn practice, the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use radioactive decay to power neutron production. One noted neutron-producing [[radioisotope]], [[californium]]-252 decays (half-life 2.65 years) by [[spontaneous fission]] 3% of the time with production of 3.7 neutrons per fission, and is used alone as a neutron source from this process. [[Nuclear reaction]] sources (that involve two materials) powered by radioisotopes use an [[alpha decay]] source plus a beryllium target, or else a source of high-energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes [[beta decay]] followed by [[gamma decay]], which produces [[photoneutron]]s on interaction of the high-energy [[gamma ray]] with ordinary stable beryllium, or else with the [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]]. A popular [[startup neutron source|source of the latter type]] is radioactive [[antimony-124]] plus beryllium, a system with a half-life of 60.9 days, which can be constructed from natural antimony (which is 42.8% stable antimony-123) by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, then transported to where the neutron source is needed.<ref>Byrne, J. \'\'Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter\'\', Dover Publications, Mineola, New York, 2011, {{ISBN|0486482383}}, pp. 32–33.</ref>\n\n[[File:Institut Laue–Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France.jpg|thumb|right|[[Institut Laue–Langevin]] (ILL) in Grenoble, France – a major neutron research facility.]]\n\n[[Nuclear reactor|Nuclear fission reactors]] naturally produce free neutrons; their role is to sustain the energy-producing [[chain reaction]].

For example, neutron capture often results in [[neutron activation]], inducing [[radioactivity]]. In particular, knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the development of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The [[nuclear fission|fissioning]] of elements like [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]] is caused by their absorption of neutrons.\n\n[[Neutron temperature|\'\'Cold\'\', \'\'thermal\'\', and \'\'hot\'\']] [[neutron radiation]] is commonly employed in [[neutron scattering]] facilities, where the radiation is used in a similar way one uses [[X-ray]]s for the analysis of [[condensed matter]].

This forms the basis of [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA) and [[prompt gamma neutron activation analysis]] (PGNAA). NAA is most often used to analyze small samples of materials in a [[nuclear reactor]] whilst PGNAA is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around [[bore hole]]s and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts.\n\nAnother use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei, in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron collides with a light nucleus, it loses a large fraction of its energy. By measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei, a [[neutron probe]] may determine the water content in soil.\n\n==Medical therapies==\n{{Main|Fast neutron therapy|Neutron capture therapy of cancer}}\nBecause neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing, it can be exploited for medical treatments. However, neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving the affected area radioactive. [[Neutron tomography]] is therefore not a viable medical application.\n\nFast neutron therapy uses high-energy neutrons typically greater than 20 MeV to treat cancer. [[Radiation therapy]] of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation. If radiation is delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas, normal tissue will have time to repair itself, while tumor cells often cannot.<ref>Hall EJ (2000). \'\'Radiobiology for the Radiologist\'\'. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 5th edition</ref> Neutron radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than [[gamma radiation]].<ref>Johns HE and Cunningham JR (1978). \'\'The Physics of Radiology\'\'. Charles C Thomas 3rd edition</ref>\n\nBeams of low-energy neutrons are used in [[neutron capture therapy of cancer|boron neutron capture therapy]] to treat cancer. In boron neutron capture therapy, the patient is given a drug that contains boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted. The tumor is then bombarded with very low-energy neutrons (although often higher than thermal energy) which are captured by the [[boron-10]] isotope in the boron, which produces an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to produce [[lithium-7]] and an [[alpha particle]] that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell, but insufficient range to damage nearby cells. For such a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer, a neutron source having an intensity of the order of a thousand million (10<sup>9</sup>) neutrons per second per cm<sup>2</sup> is preferred. Such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor.\n\n==Protection==\nExposure to free neutrons can be hazardous, since the interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s, and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of [[radiation]] (such as protons). The normal precautions of radiation protection apply: Avoid exposure, stay as far from the source as possible, and keep exposure time to a minimum. But particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure. For other types of radiation, e.g., [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, or [[gamma ray]]s, material of a high atomic number and with high density makes for good shielding; frequently, [[lead]] is used. However, this approach will not work with neutrons, since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the section on detection above). For example, [[hydrogen]]-rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons. This often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.\n\nHydrogen-rich [[water|ordinary water]] affects neutron absorption in [[nuclear fission]] reactors: Usually, neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel enrichment with fissionable isotope is required.{{clarify|reason=A step of logic is missing here. Are the neutrons needed to make something fission? Why is so much water used if it is too much?|date=May 2015}} The [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]] has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than does protium (normal light hydrogen). Deuterium is, therefore, used in [[CANDU]]-type reactors, in order to slow ([[neutron moderator|moderate]]) neutron velocity, to increase the probability of [[nuclear fission]] compared to [[neutron capture]].\n\n==Neutron temperature==\n{{Main|Neutron temperature}}\n\n===Thermal neutrons===\n\'\'Thermal neutrons\'\' are [[free neutron]]s whose energies have a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] with kT&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{val|0.0253|ul=eV}} ({{val|4.0|e=-21|ul=J}}) at room temperature. This gives characteristic (not average, or median) speed of 2.2&nbsp;km/s. The name \'thermal\' comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are permeating. (see \'\'[[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]\'\' for energies and speeds of molecules). After a number of collisions (often in the range of 10–20) with nuclei, neutrons arrive at this energy level, provided that they are not absorbed.\n\nIn many substances, thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons, and thermal neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e., with higher probability) by any [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that they collide with, creating a heavier – and often [[unstable isotope|unstable]] – [[isotope]] of the [[chemical element]] as a result.\n\nMost [[nuclear reactor|fission reactors]] use a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down, or \'\'thermalize\'\' the neutrons that are emitted by [[nuclear fission]] so that they are more easily captured, causing further fission. Others, called [[fast breeder]] reactors, use fission energy neutrons directly.\n\n===Cold neutrons===\n\'\'Cold neutrons\'\' are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold substance such as liquid [[deuterium]]. Such a \'\'cold source\'\' is placed in the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source. Cold neutrons are particularly valuable for [[neutron scattering]] experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=brian.maranville@nist.gov|date=2017-04-17|title=How neutrons are useful|url=https://www.nist.gov/ncnr/how-neutrons-are-useful|access-date=2021-01-21|journal=NIST|language=en|archive-date=2021-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125082444/https://www.nist.gov/ncnr/how-neutrons-are-useful|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nThe use of cold and very cold neutrons (VCN) have been a bit limited compared to the use of thermal neutrons due to the relatively lower flux and lack in optical components.

They are named \'\'fission energy\'\' or \'\'fast\'\' neutrons to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as [[nuclear fission]]. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean energy of 2 MeV (for <sup>235</sup>U fission neutrons), and a [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of only 0.75 MeV, which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in [[fertile material]]s, such as <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>232</sup>Th).\n\nFast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation. This is done with a [[neutron moderator]]. In reactors, typically [[heavy water]], [[light water reactor|light water]], or [[graphite]] are used to moderate neutrons.\n\n===Fusion neutrons===\n[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The D–T rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvins) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\n{{Details|Nuclear fusion#Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions}}\n\nD–T ([[deuterium]]–[[tritium]]) fusion is the [[D-T fusion|fusion reaction]] that produces the most energetic neutrons, with 14.1&nbsp;[[MeV]] of [[kinetic energy]] and traveling at 17% of the [[speed of light]]. D–T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1&nbsp;MeV that will be produced.\n\n14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons, and are very effective at fissioning even non-[[fissile]] [[actinides|heavy nuclei]], and these high-energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower-energy neutrons. This makes D–T fusion neutron sources such as proposed [[tokamak]] power reactors useful for [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of transuranic waste. 14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons can also produce neutrons by [[spallation#Nuclear spallation|knocking them loose from nuclei]].\n\nOn the other hand, these very high-energy neutrons are less likely to simply [[neutron capture|be captured without causing fission or spallation]]. For these reasons, [[nuclear weapon design]] extensively utilizes D–T fusion 14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons to [[fusion boosting|cause more fission]]. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as [[depleted uranium]] (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such as [[reactor grade plutonium]]. This physical fact thus causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain [[nuclear proliferation]] discussions and treaties.\n\nOther fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons. D–D fusion produces a 2.45&nbsp;MeV neutron and [[helium-3]] half of the time, and produces [[tritium]] and a proton but no neutron the rest of the time. D–<sup>3</sup>He fusion produces no neutron.\n\n===Intermediate-energy neutrons===\n[[File:Sasahara.svg|thumb|right|300px|Transmutation flow in [[light water reactor]], which is a thermal-spectrum reactor]]\nA fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal energies is called an epithermal neutron.\n\n[[Cross section (physics)|Cross sections]] for both [[neutron capture|capture]] and [[nuclear fission|fission]] reactions often have multiple [[resonance]] peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range. These are of less significance in a [[fast-neutron reactor]], where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing down to this range, or in a well-[[neutron moderator|moderated]] [[thermal reactor]], where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei, not with either [[fissile]] or [[fertile material|fertile]] [[actinide]] nuclides. But in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for [[transient state (chemical engineering)|transient]] changes in [[nuclear chain reaction|reactivity]] that might make reactor control more difficult.\n\nRatios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more captures without fission) in most [[nuclear fuel]]s such as [[plutonium-239]], making epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable, as captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a [[nuclide]] that is not [[fissile]] with thermal or epithermal neutrons, though still [[fissionable]] with fast neutrons. The exception is [[uranium-233]] of the [[thorium cycle]], which has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron energies.\n\n===High-energy neutrons===\nHigh-energy neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are generated as secondary particles by [[particle accelerator]]s or in the atmosphere from [[cosmic ray]]s. These high-energy neutrons are extremely efficient at [[ionization]] and far more likely to cause [[cell (biology)|cell]] death than [[X-ray]]s or protons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |title= Facing up to secondary neutrons |access-date= 2011-02-08 |author= Freeman, Tami |date= May 23, 2008 |publisher= Medical Physics Web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220151101/http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |archive-date= 2010-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title= Expand+Overview of secondary neutron production relevant to shielding in space |journal= [[Radiation Protection Dosimetry]] |year= 2005 |volume= 116 |issue= 1–4 |pages= 140–143 |doi= 10.1093/rpd/nci033 |pmid= 16604615 |last1= Heilbronn |first1= L. |last2= Nakamura |first2= T |last3= Iwata |first3= Y |last4= Kurosawa |first4= T |last5= Iwase |first5= H |last6= Townsend |first6= LW |url= http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/1nh2s8n5 |access-date= 2019-01-25 |archive-date= 2019-01-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190126060915/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1nh2s8n5 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Ionizing radiation]]\n* [[Isotope]]\n* [[List of particles]]\n* [[Neutron magnetic moment]]\n* [[Neutron radiation]] and the [[Sievert|Sievert radiation scale]]\n* [[Neutronium]]\n* [[Nuclear reaction]]\n* [[Nucleosynthesis]]\n** [[Neutron capture nucleosynthesis]]\n** [[R-process]]\n** [[S-process]]\n* [[Thermal reactor]]\n\n===Neutron sources===\n* [[Neutron generator]]\n* [[Neutron source]]\n\n===Processes involving neutrons===\n* [[Neutron bomb]]\n* [[Neutron diffraction]]\n* [[Neutron flux]]\n* [[Neutron transport]]\n* [[Cosmogenic radionuclide dating]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* James Byrne, \'\'Neutrons, Nuclei and Matter: An Exploration of the Physics of Slow Neutrons\'\'.
