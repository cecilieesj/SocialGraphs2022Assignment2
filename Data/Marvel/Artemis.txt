Artemis]</ref> She would often roam the forests of Greece, attended by her large entourage, mostly made up of nymphs, some mortals, and hunters. The goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] is her [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]] equivalent.\n\nIn Greek tradition, Artemis is the daughter of the sky god and king of gods [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin sister of [[Apollo]]. In most accounts, the twins are the products of an extramarital liaison. For this, Zeus\' wife [[Hera]] forbade Leto from giving birth anywhere on land. Only the island of [[Delos]] gave refuge to Leto, allowing her to give birth to her children. Usually, Artemis is the twin to be born first, who then proceeds to assist Leto in the birth of the second child, Apollo. Like her brother, she was a \'\'kourotrophic\'\' (child-nurturing) deity, that is the patron and protector of young children, especially young girls, and women, and was believed to both bring disease upon women and children and relieve them of it. Artemis was worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth and midwifery along with [[Eileithyia]] and [[Hera]]. Much like [[Athena]] and [[Hestia]], Artemis preferred to remain a [[Virginity|maiden]] goddess and was sworn never to marry, and was thus one of the three Greek virgin goddesses, over whom the goddess of love and lust, [[Aphrodite]], had no power whatsoever.\n\nIn myth and literature, Artemis is presented as a hunting goddess of the woods, surrounded by her followers, who is not to be crossed. In the myth of [[Actaeon]], when the young hunter sees her bathing naked, he is transformed into a deer by the angered goddess, and is then devoured by his own hunting dogs who do not recognize their own master. In the story of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], the girl is driven away from Artemis\' company after breaking her vow of virginity, having laid with and been impregnated by Zeus. In certain versions, Artemis is the one to turn Callisto into a bear, or even kill her, for her insolence.\n\nIn the [[Epic Cycle|Epic tradition]], Artemis halted the winds blowing the Greek ships during the [[Trojan War]], stranding the Greek fleet in [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]], after King [[Agamemnon]], the leader of the expedition, shot and killed her sacred deer. Artemis demanded the sacrifice of [[Iphigenia]], Agamemnon\'s young daughter, as compensation for her slain deer. In most versions, when Iphigenia is led to the altar to be offered as a sacrifice, Artemis pities her and takes her away, leaving another deer in her place. In the war that followed, Artemis along with her twin brother and mother supported the Trojans against the Greeks, and challenged Hera into battle.\n\nArtemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities, her worship spread throughout ancient Greece, with her multiple temples, altars, shrines, and local veneration found everywhere in the ancient world. Her great [[Temple of Artemis|temple]] at [[Ephesus]] was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], before it was burnt to the ground. Artemis\' symbols included a bow and arrow, a quiver, and hunting knives, and the [[deer]] and the [[Cupressus|cypress]] were sacred to her. Diana, her Roman equivalent, was especially worshipped on the [[Aventine Hill]] in [[Rome]], near [[Lake Nemi]] in the [[Alban Hills]], and in [[Campania]].<ref name=":1" />\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \'\'Artemis\'\' ([[Proper noun|\'\'noun\'\']], [[Gender (linguistics)|\'\'feminine\'\']]) is of unknown or uncertain etymology,<ref>{{cite dictionary |title=Artemis |dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Artemis&allowed_in_frame=0}}</ref><ref name="Babiniotis">{{cite book |last=Babiniotis |first=Georgios |author-link=Georgios Babiniotis |year=2005 |title=[[Dictionary of Modern Greek|Λεξικό της Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας]] |chapter=Άρτεμις |publisher=Κέντρο Λεξικολογίας |location=Athens |page=286}}</ref> although various sources have been proposed.

The nymphs, panicking, rushed to cover Artemis\' naked body with their own, as Artemis splashed some water on Actaeon, saying he was welcome to share with everyone the tale of seeing her without any clothes as long as he could share it at all.

Other sources speak of fourteen children, seven sons, and seven daughters. Niobe claimed of being a better mother than Leto, for having more children than Leto\'s own two, "but the two, though they were only two, destroyed all those others."<ref>[[Homer]], \'\'[[Iliad]]\'\' 24.602 ff, trans. Lattimore.</ref> \n\nLeto was not slow to catch up on that and grew angry at the queen\'s hubris. She summoned her children and commanded them to avenge the slight against her. Swiftly Apollo and Artemis descended on Thebes. While the sons were hunting in the woods, Apollo crept up on them and slew all seven with his silver bow. The dead bodies were brought to the palace. Niobe wept for them, but did not relent, saying that even now she was better than Leto, for she still had seven children, her daughters.<ref>[[Ovid]], \'\'[[Metamorphoses]]\'\' 6.146 ff</ref>\n\nOn cue, Artemis then started shooting the daughters one by one.

Artemis plays a significant role in the war; like Leto and Apollo, Artemis took the side of the Trojans.

A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes. Either way, the girl\'s brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged.

B.C.jpg|thumb|A bronze statue of Artemis in the [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]] ([[Athens]]). It dates from the mid-4th century BCE and it was given to sculptor [[Euphranor]].]]\n\n===Virginity===\nAn important aspect of Artemis\' persona and worship was her virginity, which may seem contradictory given her role as a goddess associated with childbirth. It is likely that the idea of Artemis as a virgin goddess is related to her primary role as a huntress. Hunters traditionally abstained from sex prior to the hunt as a form of ritual purity and out of a belief that the scent would scare off potential prey. The ancient cultural context in which Artemis\' worship emerged also held that virginity was a prerequisite to marriage, and that a married woman became subservient to her husband.<ref name=Hjerrild/>\n\nIn this light, Artemis\' virginity is also related to her power and independence. Rather than a form of asexuality, it is an attribute that signals Artemis as her own master, with power equal to that of male gods. It is also possible that her virginity represents a concentration of fertility that can be spread among her followers, in the manner of earlier mother goddess figures. However, some later Greek writers did come to treat Artemis as inherently asexual and as an opposite to [[Aphrodite]].<ref name=Hjerrild>Hjerrild, B. (2009). Near Eastern equivalents to Artemis. Tobias Fischer-Hansen & Birte Poulsen, eds. \'\'From Artemis to Diana: The Goddess of Man and Beast\'\'. Museum Tusculanum Press. {{ISBN|8763507889}}, 9788763507882.</ref> Furthermore, some have described Artemis along with the goddesses [[Hestia]] and [[Athena]] as being asexual, this is mainly supported by the fact that in the Homeric Hymns, 5, \'\'To Aphrodite,\'\' where Aphrodite is described as having "no power" over the three goddesses.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59339816|title=The Homeric hymns|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|others=Jules Cashford|isbn=0-14-043782-7|location=London|oclc=59339816}}</ref>\n\n===As a mother goddess===\nDespite her virginity, both modern scholars and ancient commentaries have linked Artemis to the archetype of the [[mother goddess]]. Artemis was traditionally linked to fertility and was petitioned to assist women with childbirth. According to [[Herodotus]], the Greek playwright [[Aeschylus]] identified Artemis with [[Persephone]] as a daughter of [[Demeter]]. Her worshipers in [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]] also traditionally associated her with Demeter and Persephone. In [[Asia Minor]], she was often conflated with local mother goddess figures, such as [[Cybele]], and [[Anahita]] in [[Iran]].<ref name=Hjerrild/>\n\nHowever, the archetype of the mother goddess was not highly compatible with the Greek pantheon, and though the Greeks had adopted the worship of Cybele and other Anatolian mother goddesses as early as the 7th century BCE, she was not directly conflated with any Greek goddesses. Instead, bits and pieces of her worship and aspects were absorbed variously by Artemis, Aphrodite, and others as Eastern influence spread.<ref name=Hjerrild/>\n\n=== As the Lady of Ephesus ===\n{{Main|Temple of Artemis}}\n[[File:The Artemis of Ephesus.jpg|thumb|right|The Artemis of Ephesus, 2nd century CE ([[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]])]]\n\nAt [[Ephesus]] in [[Ionia]], [[Turkey]], her temple became one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]]. It was probably the best-known center of her worship except for Delos. There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through \'\'[[interpretatio graeca]]\'\' was worshipped primarily as a [[mother goddess]], akin to the Phrygian goddess [[Cybele]], in an ancient sanctuary where her [[cult image]] depicted the "Lady of Ephesus" adorned with multiple large beads. Excavation at the site of the \'\'Artemision\'\' in 1987–88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped [[amber]] beads that had been hung on the original wooden statue (\'\'[[xoanon]]\'\'), and these were probably carried over into later sculpted copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/98868504/49-MORRIS-Potnia-Aswiya-Anatolian-Greek-Religion|title="Potnia Aswia: Anatolian Contributions to Greek Religion" by Sarah P.

Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis\' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear\'s blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple (\'played the bear for the goddess\').<ref>\'\'[[Suda]]\'\', [https://topostext.org/work/240#al.3958 Ἄρκτος ἢ Βραυρωνίοις]</ref>\n* \'\'\'[[Boar]]\'\'\'\nThe boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame.

This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as [[Artemis Orthia]], with a sanctuary close by [[Sparta]].\n\nIn Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall, and slim, clothed in a girl\'s short skirt,<ref>Homer portrayed Artemis as girlish in the \'\'[[Iliad]]\'\'.</ref> with hunting boots, a quiver, a golden or silver bow<ref>Greek poets variously described Artemis\' bow as silver or gold: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow." ([[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis), and it is a golden bow as well in [[Ovid]], \'\'[[Metamorphoses]]\'\' 1.693, where her nymph\'s is of horn. "And how often goddess, didst thou make trial of thy silver bow?", asks [[Callimachus]] for whom it is a [[Cydonia (ancient Greece)|Cydonian]] bow that the [[Cyclopes]] make for her (Callimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis).</ref> and arrows. Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a [[hunting dog]] or stag. When portrayed as a Moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of [[Niobe]].\n\nArtemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the [[crescent]] [[moon]], such as also found on [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]] and others.\n\nOn June 7, 2007, a Roman-era bronze sculpture of \'\'[[Artemis and the Stag]]\'\' was sold at [[Sotheby\'s]] auction house in New York state by the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] for $25.5 million.\n\n== Legacy ==\n===In astronomy===\n[[105 Artemis]], the [[Artemis (crater)]], the [[Artemis Chasma]], the [[Artemis Corona]], and the [[Artemis program]] have all been named after the goddess.\n\nArtemis is the acronym for "Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol", a large [[bolometer]] camera in the [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] range that was installed in 2010 at the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] (APEX), located in the [[Atacama desert|Atacama Desert]] in northern Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apex-telescope.org/instruments/pi/artemis/ |title=APEX – Artemis |publisher=Apex-telescope.org |date=2010-01-11 |access-date=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n=== In taxonomy ===\nThe [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] genus \'\'[[Artemia]]\'\', which entirely comprises the family Artemiidae, derives from Artemis. \'\'Artemia\'\' are aquatic crustaceans known as brine shrimp, the best-known species of which, \'\'[[Artemia salina]]\'\', or [[Sea Monkeys]], was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his \'\'[[Systema Naturae]]\'\' in 1758. \'\'Artemia\'\' live in salt lakes, and although they are almost never found in an open sea, they do appear along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean coast]] near [[Ephesus]], where the [[Temple of Artemis]] once stood.\n\n=== In modern spaceflight ===\nThe [[Artemis program]] is an ongoing [[List of human spaceflight programs|crewed spaceflight program]] carried out by [[NASA]], U.S. [[Private spaceflight|commercial spaceflight companies]], and international partners such as [[European Space Agency|ESA]],<ref name="Artemis home">[https://www.nasa.gov/specials/moon2mars/].
