Choirs may perform music from the [[classical music]] repertoire, which spans from the [[Medieval music|medieval era]] to the present, or [[popular music]] repertoire. Most choirs are led by a [[conducting|conductor]], who leads the performances with arm, hand, and facial gestures.\n\nA body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus. The former term is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]) and the second to groups that perform in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is not rigid. Choirs may sing without instrumental accompaniment, with the accompaniment of a [[piano]] or [[pipe organ]], a small ensemble, or an [[orchestra]].\n\nThe term \'\'choir\'\' has the secondary definition of a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the "woodwind choir" of an orchestra, or different "choirs" of voices or instruments in a [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] composition. In typical 18th- to 21st-century [[oratorio]]s and [[mass (music)|mass]]es, chorus or choir is usually understood to imply more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.\n\n==Structure==\nChoirs are often led by a [[Conducting|conductor]] or choirmaster. Most often choirs consist of four sections intended to sing in four part harmony, but there is no limit to the number of possible parts as long as there is a singer available to sing the part: [[Thomas Tallis]] wrote a 40-part [[motet]] entitled \'\'[[Spem in alium]]\'\', for eight choirs of five parts each; [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]\'s \'\'Stabat Mater\'\' is for three choirs of 16 voices each, a total of 48 parts. Other than four, the most common number of parts are three, five, six, and eight.\n\nChoirs can sing with or without instrumental accompaniment. Singing without accompaniment is called [[a cappella]] singing (although the [[American Choral Directors Association]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://acda.org/page.asp?page=choralreviewinformationcj |title=See "Choral Reviews Format" on ACDA.org |access-date=2012-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403101844/http://acda.org/page.asp?page=choralreviewinformationcj |archive-date=2015-04-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> discourages this usage in favor of "unaccompanied", since a cappella denotes singing "as in the chapel" and much unaccompanied music today is [[secular]]). Accompanying instruments vary widely, from only one instrument (a piano or pipe organ) to a full [[orchestra]] of 70 to 100 musicians; for rehearsals a [[piano]] or [[Organ (music)|organ]] accompaniment is often used, even if a different instrumentation is planned for performance, or if the choir is rehearsing unaccompanied music.\n\nMany choirs perform in one or many locations such as a church, opera house, or school hall. In some cases choirs join up to become one "mass" choir that performs for a special concert. In this case they provide a series of songs or musical works to celebrate and provide entertainment to others.\n\n===Role of conductor===\n[[Conducting]] is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as a choral [[concert]], by way of visible gestures with the hands, arms, face and head. The primary duties of the conductor or choirmaster are to unify [[musician|performers]], set the [[tempo]], execute clear preparations and beats ([[meter (music)|meter]]), and to listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|author1=Michael Kennedy|author-link1=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|author2=Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=9780199203833|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic2007kenn}}</ref>\n\nIn most choirs, the same individual acts as musical director (responsible for deciding the repertoire and engaging soloists and accompanists), chorus master (or répétiteur) (responsible for training and rehearsing the singers), and conductor (responsible for directing the performance). However, these roles may be divided, especially when the choir is combined with other forces, for example in [[opera]].\n\nThe conductor or choral director typically stands on a raised platform and he or she may or may not use a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]]; using a baton gives the conductor\'s gestures greater visibility, but many choral conductors prefer conducting with their hands for greater expressiveness, particularly when working with a smaller ensemble. In the 2010s, most conductors do not play an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, conductors performing in the 2010s may lead an ensemble while playing a [[harpsichord]] or the violin (see [[Concertmaster]]). Conducting while playing a [[piano]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz [[big band]]s or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, the conductor will often give verbal instructions to the ensemble, since they generally also serve as an artistic director who crafts the ensemble\'s interpretation of the music.\n\nConductors act as guides to the choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, repetitions of sections, assignment of vocal solos and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the singers. Choral conductors may also have to conduct instrumental ensembles such as [[orchestra]]s if the choir is singing a piece for choir and orchestra. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor of an Ensemble|author=Espie Estrella|website=about.com|access-date=26 September 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012250/http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |archive-date=April 15, 2013 }}</ref> planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s, and promoting their ensemble in the media.\n\n== In worship services ==\n\nHistorically, the sung repertoire divides into [[religious music|sacred or religious music]] and [[secular music]]. While much religious music has been written with concert performance in mind, its origin lies in its role within the context of [[liturgy]].\n\n===Accompaniment===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}\n[[File:Egyptian Alexandria Jews. Choir of Rabbin Moshe Cohen in Samuel Menashe synagogue. Alexandria.jpg|thumb|Egyptian Alexandria Jewish choir of Rabbin Moshe Cohen at Samuel Menashe synagogue, [[Alexandria]], Egypt]]\nMost [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian churches, some American Protestant groups, and traditional Jewish [[synagogue]]s do not accompany their songs with musical instruments. In churches of the [[Latin liturgical rites|Western Rite]] the accompanying instrument is usually the organ, although in [[colonial America]], the [[Moravian Church]] used groups of strings and winds. Many churches which use a contemporary worship format use a small amplified band to accompany the singing, and Roman Catholic Churches may use, at their discretion, additional orchestral accompaniment.\n\n===Liturgical function===\n\nIn addition to leading of singing in which the [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] participates, such as [[hymn]]s and service music, some church choirs sing full liturgies, including [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] (introit, gradual, communion antiphons appropriate for the different times of the [[liturgical year]]). Chief among these are the [[Anglican church music|Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches; far more common however is the performance of [[anthem]]s or [[motet]]s at designated times in the service.\n\n== Types==\n[[File:Cantores Minores C IMG 7407.JPG|thumb|The [[Boys\' choir|boychoir]] [[Cantores Minores]] in the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] in 2013]]\nOne of the main classifications of choirs is by gender and age since these factors greatly affect how a choir sounds and what music it performs.  The types are listed here in approximate descending order of prevalence at the professional and advanced amateur or semi-professional levels.\n\n* Adult mixed choir (with male and female voices). This is perhaps the most common and dominant type, usually consisting of [[soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], and [[bass (voice type)|bass]] voices, often abbreviated as [[SATB]].<ref name="choir_gender">{{cite web |publisher= Norton Centre|title= The gendered choir|year=2016 | author= Dr. Barbara Hall | url= http://nortoncenter.com/2016/01/22/the-gendered-choir/|access-date=26 December 2020}}</ref> Often one or more voices is divided into two, e.g., SSAATTBB, where each voice is divided into two parts, and SATBSATB, where the choir is divided into two semi-independent four-part choirs. Occasionally [[baritone]] voice is also used (e.g., SATBarB), often sung by the higher basses. In smaller choirs with fewer men, SAB, or Soprano, Alto, and Baritone arrangements allow the few men to share the role of both the tenor and bass in a single part.\n* Male choir (or choir of men & boys) with the same SATB voicing as a mixed choir, but with boys singing the upper part (often called [[Choirboy|trebles]] or [[boy soprano]]s) and men singing alto (in [[falsetto]]), also known as [[countertenor]]s. This format is typical of the British cathedral choir (e.g. [[Choir of King\'s College, Cambridge|King\'s College]], [[St Paul\'s Cathedral#Choir|St Paul\'s]], [[Westminster Abbey Choir School|Westminster Abbey]]).\n* [[Men\'s chorus]] (Male voice choir, [[Männerchor]]), a choir of adult men, low voices only, usually consisting of two tenors, baritone, and bass, often abbreviated as TTBB (or ATBB if the upper part sings [[falsetto]] in alto range). ATBB may be seen in some [[barbershop quartet]] music.\n* [[Boys\' choir]], a choir of boys, typically singing SSA or SSAA, sometimes including a cambiata/tenor part for boys/young men whose voices are changing and a baritone part for boys/young men whose voices have changed.\n* [[Women\'s choir]], a choir of adult women, high voices only, usually consisting of soprano and alto voices, two parts in each, often abbreviated as [[SSAA (choir)|SSAA]], or as soprano I, soprano II, and alto, abbreviated SSA.  \n* Children\'s mixed choir (with male and female voices), often two-part SA or three-part SSA, sometimes more voices.\n* [[Women\'s choir|Girls\' choir]], a choir of girls, high voices only, typically SSA or SSAA.\n\nThe women\'s, mixed children\'s, and all-girls\' choirs tend to be professionally less prevalent than the high voiced boys\' choirs, the lower voiced men\'s choruses, or the full SATB choirs.<ref name="choir_gender"/>\n\nChoirs are also categorized by the institutions in which they operate:\n\n[[File:School choir.jpg|thumb|[[Lambrook| Lambrook School]] choir in the 1960s, a typical boys\' school choir of the time]]\n* [[Church (building)|Church]] (including cathedral) choirs\n* [[Chorale]] (Kantorei), dedicated to mostly sacred Christian music\n* Collegiate and university choir\n* Community choir (of children or adults)\n* Professional choir, either independent (e.g. [[Anúna]], [[The Sixteen]]) or state-supported (e.g., [[BBC Singers]], [[National Chamber Choir of Ireland]], [[Canadian Chamber Choir]], [[Swedish Radio Choir]], [[Nederlands Kamerkoor]], [[Latvian Radio Choir]])\n* School choirs\n* [[Sign singing|Signing choir]] using [[sign language]] rather than voices\n* Integrated signing and singing choir, using both sign language and voices and led by both a signductor and a musical director\n* Cambiata choirs, for adolescent boys whose voices are changing.\n\nSome choirs are categorized by the type of music they perform, such as\n* [[List of Bach choirs|Bach choir]]\n* [[Barbershop music]] group\n* [[Gospel music|Gospel choir]]\n* [[Show choir]], in which the members sing and dance, often in performances somewhat like [[Musical theater|musical]]s\n* Symphonic choir\n* [[Vocal jazz]] choir\n\n=== In schools ===\n{{expand section|date=April 2020|1=British cathedral choirs are usually also made from pupils enrolled in schools...

One kind of choir popular in high schools is [[show choir]]. Middle school and high school is an important time, as it is when students\' voices are changing. Although girls experience [[voice change]], it is much more drastic in boys.

It is the conductor\'s decision on where the different voice types are placed. In symphonic choirs it is common (though by no means universal) to order the choir behind the orchestra from highest to lowest voices from left to right, corresponding to the typical string layout. In \'\'a cappella\'\' or piano-accompanied situations it is not unusual for the men to be in the back and the women in front; some conductors prefer to place the basses behind the sopranos, arguing that the outer voices need to tune to each other.\n\nMore experienced choirs may sing with the voices all mixed. Sometimes singers of the same voice are grouped in pairs or threes. Proponents of this method argue that it makes it easier for each individual singer to hear and tune to the other parts, but it requires more independence from each singer. Opponents argue that this method loses the spatial separation of individual voice lines, an otherwise valuable feature for the audience, and that it eliminates sectional resonance, which lessens the effective volume of the chorus. For music with double (or multiple) choirs, usually the members of each choir are together, sometimes significantly separated, especially in performances of 16th-century music (such as works in the [[Venetian polychoral style]]). Some composers actually specify that choirs should be separated, such as in [[Benjamin Britten]]\'s \'\'[[War Requiem]]\'\'. Some composers use separated choirs to create "antiphonal" effects, in which one choir seems to "answer" the other choir in a musical dialogue.\n\nConsideration is also given to the spacing of the singers. Studies have found that not only the actual formation, but the amount of space (both laterally and circumambiently) affects the perception of sound by choristers and auditors.<ref>Daugherty, J. "Spacing, Formation, and Choral Sound: Preferences and Perceptions of Auditors and Choristers." \'\'[[Journal of Research in Music Education]]\'\'.

The original [[Greek chorus]] sang its part in [[Greek drama]], and fragments of works by [[Euripides]] (\'\'[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]\'\') and [[Sophocles]] (\'\'[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]]\'\') are known from [[papyri]]. The [[Seikilos epitaph]] (2c BC) is a complete song (although possibly for solo voice).

This tradition of unison choir singing lasted from sometime between the times of [[St. Ambrose]] (4th century) and [[Gregory the Great]] (6th century) up to the present. During the later Middle Ages, a new type of singing involving multiple melodic parts, called [[organum]], became predominant for certain functions, but initially this [[polyphony]] was only sung by soloists. Further developments of this technique included [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, [[conductus]] and the [[motet]] (most notably the [[isorhythm]]ic motet), which, unlike the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] motet, describes a composition with different texts sung simultaneously in different voices. The first evidence of polyphony with more than one singer per part comes in the [[Old Hall Manuscript]] (1420, though containing music from the late 14th century), in which there are apparent\'\' divisi\'\', one part dividing into two simultaneously sounding notes.\n\n===Renaissance music===\n{{Main|Renaissance music}}\n\n[[File:Cantoria luca della robbia22.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Luca della Robbia]]\'s \'\'Cantoria\'\', \'\'[[Museo dell\'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell\'Opera del Duomo]]\'\', Florence]]\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], sacred choral music was the principal type of formally notated music in Western Europe. Throughout the era, hundreds of [[mass (music)|mass]]es and [[motet]]s (as well as various other forms) were composed for [[a cappella]] choir, though there is some dispute over the role of instruments during certain periods and in certain areas. Some of the better-known composers of this time include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[John Dunstaple|John Dunstable]], and [[William Byrd]]; the glories of Renaissance [[polyphony]] were choral, sung by choirs of great skill and distinction all over Europe. Choral music from this period continues to be popular with<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08331 |title=Dunstaple [Dunstable, Dunstapell, Dumstable, Donstaple, etc.], John|last=Bent|first=Margaret |date=1 January 2001|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> many choirs throughout the world today.\n\nThe [[madrigal]], a [[partsong]] conceived for amateurs to sing in a [[Chamber choir|chamber]] setting, originated at this period. Although madrigals were initially dramatic settings of unrequited-love poetry or mythological stories in Italy, they were imported into England and merged with the more dancelike [[balletto]], celebrating carefree songs of the seasons, or eating and drinking. To most English speakers, the word \'\'madrigal\'\' now refers to the latter, rather than to madrigals proper, which refers to a poetic form of lines consisting of seven and eleven syllables each.\n\nThe interaction of sung voices in Renaissance polyphony influenced Western music for centuries. Composers are routinely trained in the "Palestrina style" to this day, especially as codified by the 18th century music theorist [[Johann Joseph Fux]]. Composers of the early 20th century also wrote in Renaissance-inspired styles. [[Herbert Howells]] wrote a \'\'Mass in the Dorian mode\'\' entirely in strict Renaissance style, and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]\'s [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] is an extension of this style. [[Anton Webern]] wrote his dissertation on the \'\'[[Choralis Constantinus]]\'\' of [[Heinrich Isaac]] and the contrapuntal techniques of his [[serial music]] may be informed by this study.\n\n===Baroque music===\n[[File:Soloquartet and strings.jpg|thumb|right|Baroque cantata with one voice per part]]\nThe [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] in music is associated with the development around 1600 of the \'\'[[figured bass]]\'\' and the [[basso continuo]] system. The figured bass part was performed by the basso continuo group, which at minimum included a chord-playing instrument (e.g., [[pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], [[lute]]) and a bass instrument (e.g., [[violone]]). Baroque vocal music explored dramatic implications in the realm of solo vocal music such as the [[monody|monodies]] of the [[Florentine Camerata]] and the development of early [[opera]]. This innovation was in fact an extension of established practice of accompanying choral music at the organ, either from a skeletal reduced score (from which otherwise lost pieces can sometimes be reconstructed) or from a \'\'basso seguente\'\', a part on a single staff containing the lowest sounding part (the bass part).\n\nA new genre was the vocal [[concertato]], combining voices and instruments; its origins may be sought in the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]].\n[[Claudio Monteverdi]] (1567–1643) brought it to perfection with his [[Vespro della Beata Vergine|Vespers]] and his Eighth Book of Madrigals, which call for great virtuosity on the part of singers and instruments alike. (His Fifth Book includes a \'\'basso continuo\'\' "for harpsichord or lute".) His pupil [[Heinrich Schütz]] (1585–1672) (who had earlier studied with [[Giovanni Gabrieli]]) introduced the new style to Germany. Alongside the new music of the \'\'[[seconda pratica]]\'\', contrapuntal motets in the \'\'[[Prima pratica|stile antico]]\'\' or old style continued to be written well into the 19th century. Choirs at this time were usually quite small and that singers could be [[vocal weight|classified]] as suited to church or to chamber singing. Monteverdi, himself a singer, is documented as taking part in performances of his Magnificat with one voice per part.<ref>Richard Wistreich: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160131222106/http://em.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXII/1/7.citation "\'La voce e grata assai, ma..\' Monteverdi on Singing"] in \'\'[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]\'\', February 1994</ref>\n\nIndependent instrumental accompaniment opened up new possibilities for choral music. [[Anthem|Verse anthem]]s alternated accompanied solos with choral sections; the best-known composers of this genre were [[Orlando Gibbons]] and [[Henry Purcell]]. [[Grands motet]]s (such as those of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] and [[Michel-Richard Delalande|Delalande]]) separated these sections into separate movements. [[Oratorio]]s (of which [[Giacomo Carissimi]] was a pioneer) extended this concept into concert-length works, usually based on Biblical or moral stories.\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 44 hallelujah.ogg|title=Hallelujah Chorus|description=The Hallelujah Chorus, from [[George Frideric Handel]]\'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]], is one of the most famous choruses of all time}}\nA pinnacle of baroque choral music, (particularly oratorio), may be found in [[George Frideric Handel]]\'s works, notably \'\'[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]\'\' and \'\'[[Israel in Egypt]]\'\'. While the modern chorus of hundreds had to await the growth of Choral Societies and his centennial commemoration concert, we find Handel already using a variety of performing forces, from the soloists of the \'\'[[Chandos Anthems]]\'\' to larger groups (whose proportions are still quite different from modern orchestra choruses):\n\n{{quote|Yesterday [Oct. 6] there was a Rehearsal of the [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|Coronation Anthem]] in [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster-Abby]], set to musick by the famous Mr Hendall: there being 40 voices, and about 160 [[violin family|violins]], [[Trumpet]]s, [[oboe|Hautboys]], [[timpani|Kettle-Drums]] and Bass\' proportionable..!|\'\'Norwich Gazette\'\', October 14, 1727}}\n\nLutheran composers wrote instrumentally accompanied [[cantata]]s, often based on [[chorale]] [[hymn tune|tunes]]. Substantial late 17th-century sacred choral works in the emerging German tradition exist (the cantatas of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]] being a prime example), though the Lutheran church cantata did not assume its more codified, recognizable form until the early 18th century. [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] (based in Frankfurt) wrote over 1000 cantatas, many of which were engraved and published (e.g. his \'\'Harmonische Gottesdienst\'\') and [[Christoph Graupner]] (based in Darmstadt) over 1400. The cantatas of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685–1750) are perhaps the most recognizable (and often-performed) contribution to this repertoire: his obituary mentions five complete cycles of [[Bach cantata|his cantata]]s, of which three, comprising some 200 works, are known today, in addition to [[motet]]s. Bach himself rarely used the term cantata. Motet refers to his church music without orchestra accompaniment, but instruments playing [[colla parte]] with the voices. His works with accompaniment consists of his [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], [[Missa (Bach)|Mass]]es, the [[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]] and the cantatas.\n\nA point of hot controversy today is the so-called "Rifkin hypothesis," which re-examines the famous "\'\'Entwurff\'\'" Bach\'s 1730 memo to the [[Leipzig]] City Council (\'\'A Short but Most Necessary Draft for a Well Appointed Church Music\'\') calling for at least 12 singers. In light of Bach\'s responsibility to provide music to four churches and be able to perform double choir compositions with a substitute for each voice, [[Joshua Rifkin]] concludes that Bach\'s music was normally written with [[OVPP|one voice per part]] in mind. A few sets of original performing parts include \'\'ripieni\'\' who reinforce rather than slavishly double the vocal quartet.\n\n===Classical and Romantic music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}\nComposers of the late 18th century became fascinated with the new possibilities of the symphony and other instrumental music, and generally neglected choral music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]\'s mostly sacred choral works stand out as some of his greatest (such as the "Great" Mass in C minor and [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] in D minor, the latter of which is highly regarded). [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] became more interested in choral music near the end of his life following his visits to England in the 1790s, when he heard various Handel oratorios performed by large forces; he wrote a series of masses beginning in 1797 and his two great oratorios \'\'[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]\'\'. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] wrote only two masses, both intended for liturgical use, although his \'\'[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]\'\' is probably suitable only for the grandest ceremonies due to its length, difficulty and large-scale scoring. He also pioneered the use of chorus as part of symphonic texture with his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] and [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasia]].\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Johannes Brahms - Op.45 Ein Deutsches Requiem - (04) Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen.ogg|title="Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen"|description=(How lovely is thy dwelling place) from \'\'[[Ein deutsches Requiem]]\'\' by [[Johannes Brahms]]}}\nIn the 19th century, sacred music escaped from the church and leaped onto the concert stage, with large sacred works unsuitable for church use, such as [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]\'s \'\'[[Te Deum (Berlioz)|Te Deum]]\'\' and [[Requiem (Berlioz)|Requiem]], and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]\'s \'\'[[Ein deutsches Requiem]]\'\'. [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]\'s \'\'Stabat mater\'\', [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]\'s masses, and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]\'s [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] also exploited the grandeur offered by instrumental accompaniment. Oratorios also continued to be written, clearly influenced by Handel\'s models. Berlioz\'s \'\'[[L\'enfance du Christ]]\'\' and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn\'s]] \'\'[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]\'\' and \'\'[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St Paul]]\'\' are in the category. Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Brahms also wrote secular cantatas, the best known of which are Brahms\'s \'\'[[Schicksalslied]]\'\' and \'\'[[Nänie]]\'\'.\n\nA few composers developed a cappella music, especially [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], whose masses and motets startlingly juxtapose Renaissance counterpoint with chromatic harmony. Mendelssohn and Brahms also wrote significant a cappella motets. The amateur chorus (beginning chiefly as a social outlet) began to receive serious consideration as a compositional venue for the part-songs of Schubert, [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], Mendelssohn, Brahms, and others. These \'singing clubs\' were often for women or men separately, and the music was typically in four-part (hence the name "[[part-song]]") and either a cappella or with simple instrumentation. At the same time, the [[Cecilian movement]] attempted a restoration of the pure Renaissance style in Catholic churches.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nApart from their roles in liturgy and entertainment, choirs and choruses may also have social-service functions,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Hilliard\n| first1                = R.
