The term and the concept are used in diverse fields, from [[classical thermodynamics]], where it was first recognized, to the microscopic description of nature in [[statistical physics]], and to the principles of [[information theory]]. It has found far-ranging applications in [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], in biological systems and their relation to life, in [[cosmology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[Atmospheric science|weather science]], [[climate change]], and [[information system]]s including the transmission of information in [[telecommunication]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wehrl|first=Alfred|date=1978-04-01|title=General properties of entropy|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.50.221|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=50|issue=2|pages=221–260|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.50.221|bibcode=1978RvMP...50..221W}}</ref>\n\nThe thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer [[Macquorn Rankine]] in 1850 with the names \'\'thermodynamic function\'\' and \'\'heat-potential\'\'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Truesdell |first=C. |author-link=Clifford Truesdell |date=1980 |title=The Tragicomical History of Thermodynamics, 1822–1854 |url=https://archive.org/details/tragicomicalhist0000unse |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=0387904034 |page=215 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> In 1865, German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]], one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous [[temperature]]. He initially described it as \'\'transformation-content\'\', in German \'\'Verwandlungsinhalt\'\', and later coined the term \'\'entropy\'\' from a Greek word for \'\'transformation\'\'. Referring to microscopic constitution and structure, in 1862, Clausius interpreted the concept as meaning [[disgregation]].<ref name=brush1976>[[Stephen G.

Entropy is central to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], where the entropy is highest.\n\nAustrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and [[probability distribution]]s into a new field of thermodynamics, called [[statistical mechanics]], and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behavior, in form of a simple [[logarithm]]ic law, with a [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality constant]], the [[Boltzmann constant]], that has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern [[International System of Units]] (SI).\n\nIn 1948, [[Bell Labs]] scientist [[Claude Shannon]] developed similar statistical concepts of measuring microscopic uncertainty and multiplicity to the problem of random losses of information in telecommunication signals. Upon [[John von Neumann]]\'s suggestion, Shannon named this entity of \'\'missing information\'\' in analogous manner to its use in statistical mechanics as \'\'entropy\'\', and gave birth to the field of [[information theory]].

In 1824, building on that work, Lazare\'s son, [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], published \'\'[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]\'\', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever "[[caloric theory|caloric]]" (what is now known as heat) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877, Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. The [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality constant]] in this definition, called the [[Boltzmann constant]], has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern [[International System of Units]] (SI).

The classical approach defines entropy in terms of macroscopically measurable physical properties, such as bulk mass, volume, pressure, and temperature. The statistical definition of entropy defines it in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system – modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.). The two approaches form a consistent, unified view of the same phenomenon as expressed in the second law of thermodynamics, which has found universal applicability to physical processes.\n\n=== State variables and functions of state ===\nMany [[thermodynamic properties]] are defined by physical variables that define a state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]; these are \'\'state variables\'\'. State variables depend only on the equilibrium condition, not on the path evolution to that state. State variables can be [[functions of state]], also called \'\'state functions\'\', in a sense that one state variable is a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] of other state variables. Often, if some properties of a system are determined, they are sufficient to determine the state of the system and thus other properties\' values. For example, temperature and pressure of a given quantity of gas determine its state, and thus also its volume via the [[ideal gas law]]. A system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined, and is thus a particular state, and has not only a particular volume but also a specific entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state that it had at the start of the cycle, hence the change or [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nTotal entropy may be conserved during a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. The entropy change \'\'<math display="inline">d S</math>\'\' of the system (not including the surroundings) is well-defined as heat \'\'<math display="inline">\\delta Q_\\text{rev}</math>\'\' transferred to the system divided by the system temperature \'\'<math display="inline">T</math>\'\', <math display="inline">d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math>. A reversible process is a [[Quasistatic process|quasistatic]] one that deviates only infinitesimally from thermodynamic equilibrium and avoids friction or other dissipation. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the process is also lost.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and \'\'Lost Work\'\'|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the [[Carnot cycle]], while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in \'\'\'reverse\'\'\' and return to the previous state; thus the \'\'total\'\' entropy change may still be zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero point of temperature was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clerk Maxwell|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115–158}}</ref> It is also known that the net work {{math|\'\'W\'\'}} produced by the system in one cycle is the net heat absorbed, which is the sum (or difference of the magnitudes) of the [[heat]] {{math|\'\'Q\'\'<sub>H</sub>}} > 0 absorbed from the hot reservoir and the waste heat {{math|\'\'Q\'\'<sub>C</sub>}} < 0 given off to the cold reservoir:<ref name="PlanckBook">{{cite book |last=Planck |first=M. |title=Treatise on Thermodynamics |page=§90 & §137|quote=eqs.(39), (40), & (65) |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1945}}.</ref>\n{{NumBlk||<math display="block">W=Q_\\text{H}+Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be the change of a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function \'\'entropy\'\'. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory experimental results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose. This equation shows an entropy change per Carnot cycle is zero. In fact, an entropy change in the both thermal reservoirs per Carnot cycle is also zero since that change is simply expressed by reverting the sign of each term in the equation ({{EquationNote|3}}) according to the fact that, for example, for heat transfer from the hot reservoir to the engine, the engine receives the heat while the hot reservoir loses the same amount of the heat;\n\n{{NumBlk||<math display="block"> \\Delta S_\\text{r,H}+  \\Delta S_\\text{r,C} = - Q_\\text{H} / T_\\text{H} - Q_\\text{C} / T_\\text{C} = 0</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nwhere we denote an entropy change for a thermal reservoir by {{math|1=Δ\'\'S\'\'<sub>\'\'r,i\'\'</sub> = - \'\'Q\'\'<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub>/\'\'T\'\'<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub>}}, for \'\'i\'\' as either H (Hot reservoir) or C (Cold reservoir), by considering the abovementioned signal convention of heat for the engine.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if less work is produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot\'s principle for the same thermal reservoir pair and the same heat transfer from the hot reservoir to the engine {{math|\'\'Q\'\'<sub>H</sub>}}. In this case, the right-hand side of the equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, and the equation would now be converted into an inequality<math display="block"> W < \\left(1 - \\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right) Q_\\text{H}</math>When the equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) is used to express the work as a net or total heat exchanged in a cycle, we get<math display="block"> Q_\\text{H}+Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>or<math display="block"> |Q_\\text{C}|>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>by considering the sign convention of heat where {{math|\'\'Q\'\'<sub>H</sub>}} > 0 is heat that is from the hot reservoir and is absorbed by the engine and {{math|\'\'Q\'\'<sub>C</sub>}} < 0 is the waste heat given off to the cold reservoir from the engine. So, more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. The above inequality <math> Q_\\text{H}+Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math> can be written as<math display="block">\\frac{Q_\\text{H}}{T_\\text{H}} + \\frac{Q_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{C}} < 0.</math>If we, again, denote an entropy change for a thermal reservoir by {{math|1=Δ\'\'S\'\'<sub>\'\'r,i\'\'</sub> = - \'\'Q\'\'<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub>/\'\'T\'\'<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub>}}, for \'\'i\'\' as either H (Hot reservoir) or C (Cold reservoir), by considering the abovementioned signal convention of heat for the engine, then<math display="block">\\Delta S_\\text{r,H}+  \\Delta S_\\text{r,C} > 0</math>or\n{{NumBlk||<math display="block"> \\Delta S_\\text{r,C} > - \\Delta S_\\text{r,H} = \\left \\vert \\Delta S_\\text{r,H} \\right \\vert</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}telling that the magnitude of the entropy earned by the cold reservoir is greater than the entropy lost by the hot reservoir. The net entropy change in the engine per its thermodynamic cycle is zero, so the net entropy change in the engine and both the thermal reservoirs per cycle increases if work produced by the engine is less than the work achieved by a Carnot engine in the equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).\n\nThe [[Carnot cycle]] and Carnot efficiency as shown in the equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic heat engine. Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or cyclic process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates [[Second law of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]].\n\nFor very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}} {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer in the isotherm steps (isothermal expansion and isothermal compression) of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in an increment of entropy that is equal to incremental heat transfer divided by temperature. Entropy was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually returned to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that energy may \'\'not\'\' flow to and from an isolated system, but energy flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process: <math display="inline">\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0</math>. This means the line integral <math display="inline">\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies <math display="inline">d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math>.\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the heat transferred to or from, and the entropy change of, the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that \'\'S\'\' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy Δ\'\'E\'\', and its entropy falls by Δ\'\'S\'\', a quantity at least \'\'T\'\'<sub>R</sub> Δ\'\'S\'\' of that energy must be given up to the system\'s surroundings as heat (\'\'T\'\'<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system\'s external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in physical [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. (But chemical equilibrium is not required: the entropy of a mixture of two moles of hydrogen and one mole of oxygen at 1 bar pressure and 298 K is well-defined.)\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\n{{main|Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)}}\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor—known as the [[Boltzmann constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, disorder, or \'\'mixedupness\'\' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states are available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of "disorder" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name="Sethna78" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system.

It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of ice water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between the warm room (the surroundings) and the cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room) decreases as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water, of which the entropy has increased.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the "universe" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name="McH" /><ref name="Wiley91">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|url=https://archive.org/details/chemicalbiochemi00sand|url-access=limited|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/chemicalbiochemi00sand/page/n104 91]|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name="McQuarrie817">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine. A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat cannot flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] machine. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system\'s ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name="Daintith">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature <math display="inline">T</math> absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat <math display="inline">\\delta q</math> in a reversible way, is given by <math display="inline">\\delta q / T</math>.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy <math>U</math> to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the \'\'fundamental thermodynamic relation\'\'. If external pressure <math>p</math> bears on the volume <math>V</math> as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature <math>T</math>, implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the whole-system entropy, pressure, and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] – the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings – increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of <math>\\delta q_{\\text{rev}} / T = \\Delta S</math> introduces the measurement of entropy change, <math>\\Delta S</math>. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems – always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the kilogram (unit: J⋅kg<sup>−1</sup>⋅K<sup>−1</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the \'\'molar entropy\'\' with a unit of J⋅mol<sup>−1</sup>⋅K<sup>−1</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of <math display="inline">q_{\\text{rev}} / T</math> constitute each element\'s or compound\'s standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name="ctms">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.
