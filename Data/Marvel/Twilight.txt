The solar disk is shown to scale.]]\n\'\'\'Twilight\'\'\' is [[diffuse sky radiation|light]] produced by [[sunlight]] [[scattering]] in the upper [[Earth\'s atmosphere|atmosphere]], when the Sun is below the horizon, which illuminates the lower atmosphere and the Earth\'s surface. The word twilight can also refer to the periods of time when this illumination occurs.<ref name=USNO>{{cite web |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190927072432/aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/RST_defs.php |archive-date = 2019-09-27 |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/RST_defs.php |title=Definitions from the US Astronomical Applications Dept |publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]] |access-date=2011-07-22}}</ref>\n\nThe lower the Sun is beneath the horizon, the dimmer the twilight (other factors such as atmospheric conditions being equal). When the Sun reaches 18° below the horizon, the twilight\'s brightness is nearly zero, and [[evening]] twilight becomes [[night]]time. When the Sun again reaches 18° below the horizon, nighttime becomes morning twilight. Owing to its distinctive quality, primarily the absence of [[shadow]]s and the appearance of objects [[silhouette]]d against the lit sky, twilight has long been popular with photographers and painters, who often refer to it as the [[blue hour]], after the [[French language|French]] expression \'\'l\'heure bleue\'\'.\n\nBy analogy with evening twilight, the word \'\'twilight\'\' is also sometimes used [[metaphor]]ically, to imply that something is losing strength and approaching its end. For example, very old people may be said to be "in the twilight of their lives". The [[collateral adjective]] for \'\'twilight\'\' is \'\'[[crepuscular]]\'\', which may be used to describe the behavior of animals that are most active during this period.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Definitions by geometry==\nTwilight is defined according to the [[solar elevation angle]] \'\'θ<sub>s</sub>\'\', which is the position of the geometric center of the [[sun]] relative to the horizon. There are three established and widely accepted \'\'subcategories\'\' of twilight: civil twilight (nearest the horizon), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight (farthest from the horizon).<ref name=USNO />\n\n== Civil twilight ==\n{{redirect|Civil twilight}}\n[[File:Top of Rock Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Midtown Manhattan]] during civil twilight, demonstrating [[blue hour]]]]\nCivil twilight is the period when enough natural light remains that artificial light is not needed.\n\nMorning civil twilight begins when the geometric center of the [[sun]] is 6° below the [[horizon]]<ref name="TAPN2002">ftp://ftp.flaterco.com/xtide/Bowditch.pdf#238 The American Practical Navigator, 2002; page 238</ref><ref name="GOMN" /><ref name="Cambridge">http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/public/ask/2445 University of Cambridge – Institute of Astronomy – Ask an Astronomer [\'\'\'NB: questionable source as its sources refer back to Wikipedia\'\'\']</ref> and ends at [[sunrise]].<ref name="GOMN" /><ref name="Cambridge" /><ref name="TAPN2002" /> Evening civil twilight begins at [[sunset]]<ref name="GOMN" /><ref name="Cambridge" /><ref name="TAPN2002" /> and ends  when the geometric center of the sun reaches 6° below the horizon.<ref name="TAPN2002" /><ref name="GOMN" /><ref name="Cambridge" /> In the United States\' military, the [[Acronym|initialisms]] BMCT (begin morning civil twilight, \'\'i.e.\'\' civil dawn) and EECT (end evening civil twilight, \'\'i.e.\'\' civil dusk) are used to refer to the start of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil twilight, respectively. Civil dawn is preceded by morning nautical twilight and civil [[dusk]] is followed by evening nautical twilight.[[File:Powder Blue Desert Twilight.jpg|thumb|left|Civil twilight in a small town in the [[Mojave Desert]]]]\n\nUnder clear weather conditions, civil twilight approximates the limit at which solar illumination suffices for the human eye to clearly distinguish terrestrial objects. Enough illumination renders artificial sources unnecessary for most outdoor activities.  At civil dawn and at civil dusk sunlight clearly defines the horizon while the brightest stars and planets can appear.  As observed from the Earth (see [[apparent magnitude]]), sky-gazers know [[Venus]], the brightest planet, as the "morning star" or "evening star" because they can see it during civil twilight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/civil-twilight.html|title=What Is Civil Twilight?|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref>\n\nLawmakers have enshrined the concept of civil twilight. Such statutes typically use a fixed period after sunset or before sunrise (most commonly 20–30 minutes), rather than how many degrees the sun is below the horizon. Examples include when drivers of automobiles must turn on their headlights (called [[lighting-up time]] in the UK), when hunting is restricted, or when the crime of [[burglary]] is to be treated as nighttime burglary, which carries stiffer penalties in some jurisdictions.\n\nThe period may affect when extra equipment, such as anti-collision lights, is required for aircraft to operate.<ref>{{CodeFedReg|14|121.323}}</ref> In the US, civil twilight for aviation is defined in Part 1.1 of the [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] (FARs)<ref>{{cite web |work= ELECTRONIC CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS |title= Title 14: Aeronautics and Space PART 1 – Definitions |publisher= U.S. Government Publishing Office |url= http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5322094d58036e143135918076f83a7d&mc=true&node=se14.1.1_11&rgn=div8}}\n</ref> as the time listed in the American Air Almanac.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/aira|title=The Air Almanac|website=aa.usno.navy.mil}}</ref>\n\n== Nautical twilight ==\n[[File:Twilight Toronto across Lake Ontario51km with ship5-10km.jpg|thumb|Evening nautical twilight on [[Lake Ontario]], Canada|250x250px]]Morning nautical twilight (nautical dawn) begins when the geometric center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning and ends when the geometric center of the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the morning.[[File:Twilight in Landers.jpg|thumb|left|Long exposure of nautical twilight in a small town in the Mojave Desert]]Evening nautical twilight (nautical dusk) begins when the geometric center of the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the evening and ends when the geometric center of the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the evening.<ref name="timeanddate1">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/nautical-twilight.html|title=What Is Nautical Twilight?|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name="TAPN2002"/><ref name="Cambridge"/>\n\nBefore nautical dawn and after nautical dusk, sailors cannot navigate via the horizon at sea as they cannot clearly see the horizon.<ref name="Low precision formulae"/>{{notinsourcegiven|date=April 2018}} At nautical dawn and nautical dusk, the human eye finds it difficult, if not impossible, to discern traces of illumination near the sunset or sunrise point of the horizon (\'\'first light\'\' after nautical dawn but before civil dawn and \'\'nightfall\'\' after civil dusk but before nautical dusk).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:PanoSantPere.jpg|thumb|250x250px|At the beginning of nautical twilight, artificial lighting must be used to see terrestrial objects clearly.]]Sailors can take reliable star sightings of well-known stars, during the stage of nautical twilight when they can distinguish a visible horizon for reference (i.e. after astronomic dawn or before astronomic dusk).  \nUnder good atmospheric conditions with the absence of other illumination, during nautical twilight, the human eye may distinguish general outlines of ground objects but cannot participate in detailed outdoor operations.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/RST_defs.php Rise, Set, and Twilight Definitions]</ref>\n\nNautical twilight has military considerations as well. The initialisms BMNT (begin morning nautical twilight, \'\'i.e.\'\' nautical dawn) and EENT (end evening nautical twilight, \'\'i.e.\'\' nautical dusk) are used and considered when planning military operations. A military unit may treat BMNT and EENT with heightened security, e.g. by "standing to", in which everyone assumes a defensive position. \n==Astronomical twilight==\n[[File:Nautical twilight from Santorini, Greece.jpg|thumb|Nautical twilight viewed from Santorini, Greece.]]\n=== Astronomical dawn and dusk ===\n[[File:Astronomical Dusk.jpg|thumb|right|Evening astronomical twilight ([[dusk]])]]\nAstronomical dawn is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the morning. Astronomical dusk is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the evening.

Evening astronomical twilight begins when the geometric center of the sun is 12° below the horizon in the evening and ends (astronomical dusk) when the geometric center of the sun is 18° below the horizon in the evening.<ref name="GOMN" /><ref name="Cambridge" />\nIn some places (away from urban [[light pollution]], [[moonlight]], [[aurora]]s, and other sources of light), where the sky is dark enough for nearly all astronomical observations, astronomers can easily make observations of point sources such as stars both during and after astronomical twilight in the evening and both before and during astronomical twilight in the morning. However, some critical observations, such as of faint diffuse items such as [[nebula]]e and [[galaxy|galaxies]], may require observation beyond the limit of astronomical twilight.  Theoretically, the faintest stars detectable by the naked eye (those of approximately the sixth magnitude) will become visible in the evening at [[dusk|astronomical dusk]], and become invisible at [[dawn|astronomical dawn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/astronomical-twilight.html|title=What Is Astronomical Twilight?|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in other places, especially those with [[skyglow]], astronomical twilight may be almost indistinguishable from night. In the evening, even when astronomical twilight has yet to end and in the morning when astronomical twilight has already begun, most casual observers would consider the entire sky fully dark.  Because of [[light pollution]], observers in some localities, generally in and near large cities, may never have the opportunity to view anything but the brightest stars, irrespective of the presence of any twilight at all, nor to experience anything close to a truly dark sky.\n\n==Times of occurrence==\n[[File:Twilight latitudes world map.svg|thumb|World map showing limiting latitudes of each type of twilight during the solstices]]\n\n===Between day and night===\nObservers within 48°34\' of the Equator (within 50° of the Equator in May or November, within 57° of the Equator in April or October) and within 72° of the Equator on the equinoxes can view twilight twice each day on every date of the year between astronomical [[dawn]], nautical dawn, or civil dawn, and [[sunrise]] as well as between [[sunset]] and civil dusk, nautical dusk, or astronomical [[dusk]]. This also occurs for most observers at higher latitudes on many dates throughout the year, except those around the summer solstice. However, at latitudes closer than 9 degrees (between 81° and 90°) to either Pole, the Sun cannot rise above the horizon nor sink more than 18 degrees below it on the same day on any date, this example of twilight cannot occur because the angular difference between solar noon and solar midnight elevates less than 18 degrees.\n\n=== Lasting from one day to the next ===\n[[File:Twilight and Sunrise in Gjøvik in February 2021.webm|thumb|Timelapse video of twilight and sunrise in [[Gjøvik]] in February 2021]]\nAt latitudes greater than 48°34\' North or South, on dates near the summer solstice, twilight can last from sunset to sunrise, since the Sun does not sink more than 18 degrees below the horizon, so complete darkness does not occur even at solar midnight. These latitudes include many densely populated regions of the Earth, including the entire [[United Kingdom]] and other countries in [[northern Europe]] and even parts of [[central Europe]].\n\n* Civil twilight: between 60°34\' and 65°44\' north or south (between 62° and 67°10\' north or south in May or November, between 69° and 74°10\' north or south in April or October). In the northern hemisphere, this includes the center of [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Shetland Island]]. In the southern hemisphere this includes parts of the [[Southern Ocean]] and the northern tip of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. When \'\'civil\'\' twilight lasts all night, this is also referred as a [[White night (astronomy)|white night]].\n* Nautical twilight: between 54°34\' and 60°34\' north or south (between 56° and 62° north or south in May or November, between 63° and 69° north or south in April or October). In the northern hemisphere this includes the center of [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Denmark]]. In the southern hemisphere this includes the southernmost point of [[South America]], and [[Ushuaia]] in [[Argentina]]. When \'\'nautical\'\' twilight lasts all night, this does not constitute a white night.\n* Astronomical twilight: between 48°34\' and 54°34\' north or south (between 50° and 56° north or south in May or November, between 57° and 63° north or south in April or October). In the northern hemisphere, this includes the center of [[Isle of Man]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Belarus]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Bellingham, Washington]], [[Orcas  Island, Washington]], [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Guernsey]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Slovakia]]. In the southern hemisphere this includes the center of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], [[Bouvet Island]], [[Heard Island]], [[Falkland Islands]]. It also includes [[El Calafate]] and [[Río Gallegos]] in [[Argentina]], and [[Puerto Natales]] in [[Chile]]. When \'\'astronomical\'\' twilight lasts all night, this does not constitute a white night.\n\n===Between one night and the next===\nIn [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] latitudes in wintertime, the [[polar night]] only rarely produces complete darkness for 24&nbsp;hours each day. This can occur only at locations within 5.5&nbsp;degrees of latitude of the Pole, and there only on dates close to the [[winter solstice]]. At all other latitudes and dates, the polar night includes a daily period of twilight, when the Sun is not far below the horizon. Around winter solstice, when the solar declination changes slowly, complete darkness lasts several weeks at the Pole itself, e.g., from May 11 to July 31 at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].{{efn|This is the range of dates when the Sun is more than 18&nbsp;degrees north of the [[Celestial equator]], so it is more than 18&nbsp;degrees below the horizon as seen from the South Pole. See [[Position of the Sun#Declination of the Sun as seen from Earth]].}} North Pole has the experience of this from November 13 to January 29.\n\nSolar noon at civil twilight during a polar night: between 67°24\' and 72°34\' north or south.\n\nSolar noon at nautical twilight during a polar night: between 72°34\' and 78°34\' north or south.\n\nSolar noon at astronomical twilight during a polar night: between 78°34\' and 84°34\' north or south.\n\nSolar noon at night during a polar night: between 84°34\' and 90° north or south.\n\n===Lasting for 24 hours===\nAt latitudes within 9 degrees of either Pole, as the sun\'s angular elevation difference is less than 18 degrees, twilight can last for the entire 24 hours. This occurs for one day at latitudes near 9 degrees from the Pole and extends up to several weeks the further toward the Pole one goes. The only permanent settlement to experience this condition is [[Alert, Nunavut]], Canada, where it occurs for a week in late February, and again in late October.\n\n==Duration==\n[[File:Daylight Length.svg|thumb|left|The number of daylight hours depends on the latitude and time of year. Each pole has continuous daylight near its [[summer solstice]].]]\n[[File:Carpet Plot of Sun-Elevation over a whole Year - North of the Polar Circle.png|thumb|[[Carpet plot]] of sunshine at latitude 70° north]]\n[[File:Carpet Plot of Sun-Elevation over a whole Year - Frankfurt.png|thumb|Carpet plot of sunshine at latitude 50° north]]\n[[File:Carpet Plot of Sun-Elevation over a whole Year - Equator.png|thumb|Carpet plot of sunshine at the equator]]\n[[File:Venus and the Moon strike a pose.jpg|thumb|Twilight at [[Paranal Observatory]] in Chile<ref>{{cite web |title=Venus and the Moon strike a pose |url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1616a/ |access-date=18 April 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nThe duration of twilight depends on the latitude and the time of the year. The apparent travel of the sun occurs at the rate of 15 degrees per hour (360° per day), but sunrise and sunset happen typically at oblique angles to the horizon and the actual duration of any twilight period will be a function of that angle, being longer for more oblique angles. This angle of the sun\'s motion with respect to the horizon changes with [[latitude]] as well as the time of year (affecting the angle of the Earth\'s axis with respect to the sun).\n\nAt [[Greenwich, England]] (51.5°N), the duration of civil twilight will vary from 33 minutes to 48 minutes, depending on the time of year. At the [[equator]], civil twilight can last as little as 24 minutes. This is true because at [[low latitudes]] the sun\'s apparent movement is [[perpendicular]] to the observer\'s horizon. But at the poles, civil twilight can be as long as 2–3 weeks. In the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions, twilight (if there is any) can last for several hours. There is no astronomical twilight at the poles near the [[winter solstice]] (for about 74 days at the North Pole and about 80 days at the South Pole). As one gets closer to the Arctic and Antarctic circles, the sun\'s disk moves toward the observer\'s horizon at a lower angle. The observer\'s earthly location will pass through the various twilight zones less directly, taking more time.\n\nWithin the [[polar circle]]s, [[midnight sun|twenty-four-hour daylight]] is encountered in summer, and in regions very close to the poles, twilight can last for weeks on the winter side of the [[equinox]]es. Outside the polar circles, where the angular distance from the polar circle is less than the angle which defines twilight (see above), twilight can continue through local midnight near the [[summer solstice]]. The precise position of the polar circles, and the regions where twilight can continue through local midnight, varies slightly from year to year with Earth\'s [[axial tilt]]. The lowest latitudes at which the various twilights can continue through local midnight are approximately 60.561° (60°33′43″) for civil twilight, 54.561° (54°33′43″) for nautical twilight and 48.561° (48°33′43″) for astronomical twilight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gandraxa.com/length_of_day.xml |title=Length of Day and Twilight (Formulas) |publisher=www.gandraxa.com |access-date=2011-08-26}}</ref><ref>Herbert Glarner\'s website, reference 2.

Many [[ritual]]s, including [[Sandhyavandanam]] and [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]], are performed at twilight hour. Eating of food is not advised during this time. Sometimes it is referred to as Asurasandhya vela. It is believed that [[Asura]]s are active during these hours. One of the avatars of Lord [[Vishnu]], [[Narasimha]], is closely associated with the twilight period. According to [[Hindu scriptures]], a daemonic king, [[Hiranakashipa]], performed penance and obtained a boon from [[Brahma]] that he could not be killed during day or night and neither by human nor animal. Lord [[Vishnu]] appeared in a half-man half-lion form (neither human nor animal), ended the life of Hiranakashipa during twilight (neither day nor night).<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGEXAAAAIAAJ |title=India democracy and education | author=Jossleyn Hennessy |publisher=Orient Longmans |year=1955 |chapter=ch.

Morning twilight is when morning prayers (\'\'[[Fajr]]\'\') are done, while evening twilight is the time for evening prayers (\'\'[[Maghrib prayer]]\'\'). Also during Ramadhan, the time for \'\'suhoor\'\' (morning meal before fasting) ends at morning twilight, while fasting ends after sunset.
