Being [[fermion]]s, no two electrons can occupy the same [[quantum state]], in accordance with the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].<ref name=curtis74/> Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of [[wave-particle duality|both particles and waves]]: They can collide with other particles and can be [[electron diffraction|diffracted]] like light. The [[#Quantum properties|wave properties of electrons]] are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like [[neutron]]s and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer [[de Broglie wavelength]] for a given energy.\n\nElectrons play an essential role in numerous [[physics|physical]] phenomena, such as [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[chemistry]] and [[thermal conductivity]], and they also participate in [[gravitational wave|gravitational]], [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]].<ref name="anastopoulos1" /> Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding [[electric field]], and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, said observer will observe it to generate a [[magnetic field]]. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the [[Lorentz force law]]. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of [[photon]]s when they are accelerated.\nLaboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as [[Plasma (physics)|electron plasma]] by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special [[telescope]]s can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as tribology or frictional charging, electrolysis, electrochemistry, battery technologies, [[electronics]], [[Electron beam welding|welding]], [[cathode-ray tube]]s, photoelectricity, photovoltaic solar panels,  [[electron microscope]]s, [[radiation therapy]], [[Free-electron laser|lasers]], [[gaseous ionization detectors]] and [[particle accelerator]]s.\n\nInteractions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The [[Coulomb\'s law|Coulomb force]] interaction between the positive [[proton]]s within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as [[atom]]s. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the [[binding energy]] of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of [[chemical bond]]ing.<ref name=Pauling /> In 1838, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of atoms.<ref name="arabatzis" /> Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] named this charge \'electron\' in 1891, and [[J. J. Thomson]] and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 during the [[cathode ray|cathode-ray tube experiment]].<ref name="thomson" />  Electrons can also participate in [[nuclear reaction]]s, such as [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis in stars]], where they are known as [[beta particle]]s. Electrons can be created through [[beta decay]] of [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and in high-energy collisions, for instance when [[cosmic ray]]s enter the atmosphere.  The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called the [[positron]]; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical [[charge (physics)|charge]] of the opposite sign. When an [[Electron–positron annihilation|electron collides with a positron]], both particles can be [[annihilation|annihilated]], producing [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory|label 1=History of electromagnetism}}\n\n=== Discovery of effect of electric force ===\nThe [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|ancient Greeks]] noticed that [[amber]] attracted small objects when rubbed with fur.

In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function, the [[wave function]], commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (\'\'ψ\'\').

If the particles swap position, the wave function inverts its sign.]]\nElectrons are [[identical particles]] because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, {{nowrap|\'\'ψ\'\'(\'\'r\'\'<sub>1</sub>, \'\'r\'\'<sub>2</sub>) {{=}} −\'\'ψ\'\'(\'\'r\'\'<sub>2</sub>, \'\'r\'\'<sub>1</sub>)}}, where the variables \'\'r\'\'<sub>1</sub> and \'\'r\'\'<sub>2</sub> correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. [[Boson]]s, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.<ref name="munowitz" />{{rp|162–218}}\n\nIn the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a [[zero probability]] that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This is responsible for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.<ref name="munowitz" />{{rp|162–218}}\n\n=== Virtual particles ===\n{{Main|Virtual particle}}\nIn a simplified picture, which often tends to give the wrong idea but may serve to illustrate some aspects, every photon spends some time as a combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle, the virtual positron, which rapidly [[Annihilation|annihilate]] each other shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite magazine\n | last = Kane | first = G.\n | date = October 9, 2006\n | url = https://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=are-virtual-particles-rea&topicID=13\n | title = Are virtual particles really constantly popping in and out of existence?
