Waves can be [[Periodic function|periodic]], in which case those quantities oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium (resting) value at some [[frequency]]. When the entire [[waveform]] moves in one direction, it is said to be a \'\'traveling wave\'\'; by contrast, a pair of [[superposition principle|superimposed]] periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a \'\'[[standing wave]]\'\'. In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero. Waves are often described by a \'\'[[wave equation]]\'\' (standing wave field of two opposite waves) or a [[one-way wave equation]] for single wave propagation in a defined direction. \n\nTwo types of waves are most commonly studied in classical physics. In a \'\'[[mechanical wave]]\'\', [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Strain (mechanics)|strain]] fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium. A mechanical wave is a local [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation (strain)]] in some physical medium that propagates from particle to particle by creating local [[stress (mechanics)|stresses]] that cause strain in neighboring particles too. For example, [[sound]] waves are variations of the local [[Sound pressure|pressure]] and [[Particle velocity|particle motion]] that propagate through the medium. Other examples of mechanical waves are [[seismic wave]]s, [[gravity wave]]s, [[surface wave]]s, [[string vibration]]s, and [[vortex|vortices]]. In an \'\'[[electromagnetic wave]]\'\' (such as light), coupling between the electric and magnetic fields which sustains propagation of a wave involving these fields according to [[Maxwell\'s equations]]. Electromagnetic waves can travel through a [[vacuum]] and through some [[dielectric]] media (at wavelengths where they are considered [[transparency and translucency|transparent]]). Electromagnetic waves, according to their frequencies (or [[wavelength]]s) have more specific designations including [[radio wave]]s, [[infrared radiation]], [[terahertz waves]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet radiation]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nOther types of waves include [[gravitational wave]]s, which are disturbances in [[spacetime]] that propagate according to [[general relativity]]; [[heat equation|heat diffusion waves]]; [[plasma wave]]s that combine mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields; [[reaction–diffusion system|reaction–diffusion waves]], such as in the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]; and many more. Mechanical and electromagnetic waves transfer [[energy]],<ref>{{Harv|Hall|1982| p=8}}</ref> [[momentum (physics)|momentum]], and [[information]], but they do not transfer particles in the medium. In mathematics and [[electronics]] waves are studied as [[signal]]s.<ref>Pragnan Chakravorty, "What Is a Signal?

For example, the seismic waves generated by [[earthquakes]] are significant only in the interior and surface of the planet, so they can be ignored outside it. However, waves with infinite domain, that extend over the whole space, are commonly studied in mathematics, and are very valuable tools for understanding physical waves in finite domains.\n\nA \'\'[[plane wave]]\'\' is an important mathematical idealization where the disturbance is identical along any (infinite) plane [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to a specific direction of travel. Mathematically, the simplest wave is a \'\'[[sinusoidal plane wave]]\'\' in which at any point the field experiences [[simple harmonic motion]] at one frequency. In linear media, complicated waves can generally be decomposed as the sum of many sinusoidal plane waves having [[Angular spectrum method|different directions of propagation]] and/or [[Fourier transform|different frequencies]]. A plane wave is classified as a \'\'[[transverse wave]]\'\' if the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector perpendicular to the direction of propagation (also the direction of energy transfer); or \'\'[[longitudinal wave]]\'\' if those vectors are aligned with the propagation direction. Mechanical waves include both transverse and longitudinal waves; on the other hand electromagnetic plane waves are strictly transverse while sound waves in fluids (such as air) can only be longitudinal. That physical direction of an oscillating field relative to the propagation direction is also referred to as the wave\'s \'\'[[polarization (waves)|polarization]]\'\', which can be an important attribute.\n\n== Mathematical description ==\n\n===Single waves===\nA wave can be described just like a field, namely as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>F(x,t)</math> where <math>x</math> is a position and <math>t</math> is a time.\n\nThe value of <math>x</math> is a point of space, specifically in the region where the wave is defined. In mathematical terms, it is usually a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] in the [[analytic geometry|Cartesian three-dimensional space]] <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>. However, in many cases one can ignore one dimension, and let <math>x</math> be a point of the Cartesian plane <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math>. This is the case, for example, when studying vibrations of a drum skin. One may even restrict <math>x</math> to a point of the Cartesian line <math>\\R</math> — that is, the set of [[real number]]s. This is the case, for example, when studying vibrations in a [[string (music)|violin string]] or [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]. The time <math>t</math>, on the other hand, is always assumed to be a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]; that is, a real number.\n\nThe value of <math>F(x,t)</math> can be any physical quantity of interest assigned to the point <math>x</math> that may vary with time. For example, if <math>F</math> represents the vibrations inside an elastic solid, the value of <math>F(x,t)</math> is usually a vector that gives the current displacement from <math>x</math> of the material particles that would be at the point <math>x</math> in the absence of vibration. For an electromagnetic wave, the value of <math>F</math> can be the [[electric field]] vector <math>E</math>, or the [[magnetic field]] vector <math>H</math>, or any related quantity, such as the [[Poynting vector]] <math>E\\times H</math>. In [[fluid dynamics]], the value of <math>F(x,t)</math> could be the velocity vector of the fluid at the point <math>x</math>, or any scalar property like [[pressure]], [[temperature]], or [[density]]. In a chemical reaction, <math>F(x,t)</math> could be the concentration of some substance in the neighborhood of point <math>x</math> of the reaction medium.\n\nFor any dimension <math>d</math> (1, 2, or 3), the wave\'s domain is then a [[subset]] <math>D</math> of <math>\\mathbb{R}^d</math>, such that the function value <math>F(x,t)</math> is defined for any point <math>x</math> in <math>D</math>. For example, when describing the motion of a [[drumhead|drum skin]], one can consider <math>D</math> to be a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] (circle) on the plane <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> with center at the origin <math>(0,0)</math>, and let <math>F(x,t)</math> be the vertical displacement of the skin at the point <math>x</math> of <math>D</math> and at time <math>t</math>.\n\n===Wave families===\nSometimes one is interested in a single specific wave. More often, however, one needs to understand large set of possible waves; like all the ways that a drum skin can vibrate after being struck once with a [[drum stick]], or all the possible [[radar]] echos one could get from an [[airplane]] that may be approaching an [[airport]].\n\nIn some of those situations, one may describe such a family of waves by a function <math>F(A,B,\\ldots;x,t)</math> that depends on certain [[parameter]]s <math>A,B,\\ldots</math>, besides <math>x</math> and <math>t</math>. Then one can obtain different waves — that is, different functions of <math>x</math> and <math>t</math> — by choosing different values for those parameters.\n\n[[File:Half-open pipe wave.gif|thumb|right|Sound pressure standing wave in a half-open pipe playing the 7th harmonic of the fundamental (\'\'n\'\' = 4)]]\nFor example, the sound pressure inside a [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] that is playing a "pure" note is typically a [[standing wave]], that can be written as\n:<math>F(A,L,n,c;x,t) = A \\left(\\cos 2\\pi x\\frac{2 n - 1}{4 L}\\right) \\left(\\cos 2\\pi c t\\frac{2n - 1}{4 L}\\right)</math>\nThe parameter <math>A</math> defines the amplitude of the wave (that is, the maximum sound pressure in the bore, which is related to the loudness of the note); <math>c</math> is the speed of sound; <math>L</math> is the length of the bore; and <math>n</math> is a positive integer (1,2,3,…) that specifies the number of [[standing wave|nodes]] in the standing wave. (The position <math>x</math> should be measured from the [[wind instrument|mouthpiece]], and the time <math>t</math> from any moment at which the pressure at the mouthpiece is maximum. The quantity <math>\\lambda = 4L/(2 n - 1)</math> is the [[wavelength]] of the emitted note, and <math>f = c/\\lambda</math> is its [[frequency]].) Many general properties of these waves can be inferred from this general equation, without choosing specific values for the parameters.\n\nAs another example, it may be that the vibrations of a drum skin after a single strike depend only on the distance <math>r</math> from the center of the skin to the strike point, and on the strength <math>s</math> of the strike. Then the vibration for all possible strikes can be described by a function <math>F(r,s;x,t)</math>.\n\nSometimes the family of waves of interest has infinitely many parameters. For example, one may want to describe what happens to the temperature in a metal bar when it is initially heated at various temperatures at different points along its length, and then allowed to cool by itself in vacuum. In that case, instead of a scalar or vector, the parameter would have to be a function <math>h</math> such that <math>h(x)</math> is the initial temperature at each point <math>x</math> of the bar. Then the temperatures at later times can be expressed by a function <math>F</math> that depends on the function <math>h</math> (that is, a [[operator (mathematics)|functional operator]]), so that the temperature at a later time is <math>F(h;x,t)</math>\n\n===Differential wave equations===\nAnother way to describe and study a family of waves is to give a mathematical equation that, instead of explicitly giving the value of <math>F(x,t)</math>, only constrains how those values can change with time. Then the family of waves in question consists of all functions <math>F</math> that satisfy those constraints — that is, all [[solution (mathematics)|solutions]] of the equation.\n\nThis approach is extremely important in physics, because the constraints usually are a consequence of the physical processes that cause the wave to evolve. For example, if <math>F(x,t)</math> is the temperature inside a block of some [[homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] solid material, its evolution is constrained by the [[partial differential equation]]\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}(x,t) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x_1^2}(x,t) + \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x_2^2}(x,t) + \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x_3^2}(x,t) \\right) + \\beta Q(x,t)</math>\nwhere <math>Q(p,f)</math> is the heat that is being generated per unit of volume and time in the neighborhood of <math>x</math> at time <math>t</math> (for example, by chemical reactions happening there); <math>x_1,x_2,x_3</math> are the Cartesian coordinates of the point <math>x</math>; <math>\\partial F/\\partial t</math> is the (first) derivative of <math>F</math> with respect to <math>t</math>; and <math>\\partial^2 F/\\partial x_i^2</math> is the second derivative of <math>F</math> relative to <math>x_i</math>. (The symbol "<math>\\partial</math>" is meant to signify that, in the derivative with respect to some variable, all other variables must be considered fixed.)\n\nThis equation can be derived from the laws of physics that govern the [[heat diffusion|diffusion of heat]] in solid media. For that reason, it is called the [[heat equation]] in mathematics, even though it applies to many other physical quantities besides temperatures.\n\nFor another example, we can describe all possible sounds echoing within a container of gas by a function <math>F(x,t)</math> that gives the pressure at a point <math>x</math> and time <math>t</math> within that container. If the gas was initially at uniform temperature and composition, the evolution of <math>F</math> is constrained by the formula\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial t^2}(x,t) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x_1^2}(x,t) + \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x_2^2}(x,t) + \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x_3^2}(x,t) \\right) + \\beta P(x,t)</math>\nHere <math>P(x,t)</math> is some extra compression force that is being applied to the gas near <math>x</math> by some external process, such as a [[loudspeaker]] or [[piston]] right next to <math>p</math>.\n\nThis same differential equation describes the behavior of mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic fields in a homogeneous isotropic non-conducting solid. Note that this equation differs from that of heat flow only in that the left-hand side is <math>\\partial^2 F/\\partial t^2</math>, the second derivative of <math>F</math> with respect to time, rather than the first derivative <math>\\partial F/\\partial t</math>. Yet this small change makes a huge difference on the set of solutions <math>F</math>. This differential equation is called "the" [[wave equation]] in mathematics, even though it describes only one very special kind of waves.\n\n==Wave in elastic medium==\n<!--Still needs substantial cleanup below this point-->\n{{Main|Wave equation|D\'Alembert\'s formula}}\n\nConsider a traveling [[transverse wave]] (which may be a [[pulse (physics)|pulse]]) on a string (the medium).

That is, its value is constant on a plane that is perpendicular to that direction. Plane waves can be specified by a vector of unit length <math>\\hat n</math> indicating the direction that the wave varies in, and a wave profile describing how the wave varies as a function of the displacement along that direction (<math>\\hat n \\cdot \\vec{x}</math>) and time (<math>t</math>). Since the wave profile only depends on the position <math>\\vec{x}</math> in the combination <math>\\hat n \\cdot \\vec{x}</math>, any displacement in directions perpendicular to <math>\\hat n</math> cannot affect the value of the field.\n\nPlane waves are often used to model [[electromagnetic waves]] far from a source. For electromagnetic plane waves, the electric and magnetic fields themselves are transverse to the direction of propagation, and also perpendicular to each other.\n\n=== Standing waves ===\n{{Main|Standing wave|Acoustic resonance|Helmholtz resonator|Organ pipe}}\n\n[[File:Standing wave.gif|thumb|right|300px|Standing wave. The red dots represent the wave [[Node (physics)|nodes]]]]\n\nA standing wave, also known as a \'\'stationary wave\'\', is a wave whose [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] remains in a constant position. This phenomenon arises as a result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between two waves traveling in opposite directions.\n\nThe \'\'sum\'\' of two counter-propagating waves (of equal amplitude and frequency) creates a \'\'standing wave\'\'. Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter-propagating wave. For example, when a [[violin]] string is displaced, transverse waves propagate out to where the string is held in place at the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and the [[Nut (string instrument)|nut]], where the waves are reflected back. At the bridge and nut, the two opposed waves are in [[antiphase]] and cancel each other, producing a [[node (physics)|node]]. Halfway between two nodes there is an [[antinode]], where the two counter-propagating waves \'\'enhance\'\' each other maximally. There is no net [[Energy transfer|propagation of energy]] over time.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Standing waves on a string.gif|One-dimensional standing waves; the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] mode and the first 5 [[overtone]]s.\nImage:Drum vibration mode01.gif|A two-dimensional [[Vibrations of a circular drum|standing wave on a disk]]; this is the fundamental mode.\nImage:Drum vibration mode21.gif|A [[Vibrations of a circular drum|standing wave on a disk]] with two nodal lines crossing at the center; this is an overtone.\n</gallery>\n\n== Physical properties ==\n\n[[File:Light dispersion of a mercury-vapor lamp with a flint glass prism IPNr°0125.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Light beam exhibiting reflection, refraction, transmission and dispersion when encountering a prism]]\n\nWaves exhibit common behaviors under a number of standard situations, for example:\n\n=== Transmission and media ===\n{{Main|Rectilinear propagation|Transmittance|Transmission medium}}\n\nWaves normally move in a straight line (that is, rectilinearly) through a \'\'[[transmission medium]]\'\'. Such media can be classified into one or more of the following categories:\n* A \'\'bounded medium\'\' if it is finite in extent, otherwise an \'\'unbounded medium\'\'\n* A \'\'linear medium\'\' if the amplitudes of different waves at any particular point in the medium can be added\n* A \'\'uniform medium\'\' or \'\'homogeneous medium\'\' if its physical properties are unchanged at different locations in space\n* An \'\'anisotropic medium\'\' if one or more of its physical properties differ in one or more directions\n* An \'\'isotropic medium\'\' if its physical properties are the \'\'same\'\' in all directions\n\n=== Absorption ===\n{{Main|Absorption (acoustics)|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}\nWaves are usually defined in media which allow most or all of a wave\'s energy to propagate without [[Insertion loss|loss]]. However materials may be characterized as "lossy" if they remove energy from a wave, usually converting it into heat. This is termed "absorption." A material which absorbs a wave\'s energy, either in transmission or reflection, is characterized by a [[refractive index]] which is [[Complex number|complex]]. The amount of absorption will generally depend on the frequency (wavelength) of the wave, which, for instance, explains why objects may appear colored.\n\n=== Reflection ===\n{{Main|Reflection (physics)}}\n\nWhen a wave strikes a reflective surface, it changes direction, such that the angle made by the [[incident ray|incident wave]] and line [[perpendicular|normal]] to the surface equals the angle made by the reflected wave and the same normal line.\n\n=== Refraction ===\n{{Main|Refraction}}\n\n[[File:Wave refraction.gif|thumb|right|200 px|Sinusoidal traveling plane wave entering a region of lower wave velocity at an angle, illustrating the decrease in wavelength and change of direction (refraction) that results.]]\n\nRefraction is the phenomenon of a wave changing its speed. Mathematically, this means that the size of the [[phase velocity]] changes. Typically, refraction occurs when a wave passes from one [[Transmission medium|medium]] into another. The amount by which a wave is refracted by a material is given by the [[refractive index]] of the material. The directions of incidence and refraction are related to the refractive indices of the two materials by [[Snell\'s law]].\n\n=== Diffraction ===\n{{Main|Diffraction}}\n\nA wave exhibits diffraction when it encounters an obstacle that bends the wave or when it spreads after emerging from an opening. Diffraction effects are more pronounced when the size of the obstacle or opening is comparable to the wavelength of the wave.\n\n=== Interference ===\n{{Main|Interference (wave propagation)}}\n[[Image:Two sources interference.gif|right|frame|Identical waves from two sources undergoing [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. Observed at the bottom one sees 5 positions where the waves add in phase, but in between which they are out of phase and cancel.]]\n\nWhen waves in a linear medium (the usual case) cross each other in a region of space, they do not actually interact with each other, but continue on as if the other one weren\'t present. However at any point \'\'in\'\' that region the \'\'field quantities\'\' describing those waves add according to the [[superposition principle]]. If the waves are of the same frequency in a fixed [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship, then there will generally be positions at which the two waves are \'\'in phase\'\' and their amplitudes \'\'add\'\', and other positions where they are \'\'out of phase\'\' and their amplitudes (partially or fully) \'\'cancel\'\'. This is called an [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]].\n\n=== Polarization ===\n{{Main|Polarization (waves)}}\n\n[[File:Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light Circular.Polarizer Creating.Left.Handed.Helix.View.svg|thumb|left]]\n\nThe phenomenon of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two [[orthogonal]] directions. [[Transverse wave]]s can be polarized, for instance. When polarization is used as a descriptor without qualification, it usually refers to the special, simple case of [[linear polarization]]. A transverse wave is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane. In the case of linear polarization, it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane, perpendicular to the direction of travel, in which the oscillation occurs, such as "horizontal" for instance, if the plane of polarization is parallel to the ground. [[Electromagnetic waves]] propagating in free space, for instance, are transverse; they can be polarized by the use of a [[polarizer|polarizing filter]].\n\nLongitudinal waves, such as sound waves, do not exhibit polarization. For these waves there is only one direction of oscillation, that is, along the direction of travel.\n\n=== Dispersion ===\n\n[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|right|270 px|Schematic of light being dispersed by a prism. Click to see animation.]]\n\n{{Main|Dispersion relation|Dispersion (optics)|Dispersion (water waves)}}\n\nA wave undergoes dispersion when either the [[phase velocity]] or the [[group velocity]] depends on the wave frequency.\nDispersion is most easily seen by letting white light pass through a [[prism (optics)|prism]], the result of which is to produce the spectrum of colors of the rainbow.

An electromagnetic wave travels in a direction that is at right angles to the oscillation direction of both fields. In the 19th century, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed that, in [[vacuum]], the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the [[wave equation]] both with speed equal to that of the [[speed of light]]. From this emerged the idea that [[visible light|light]] is an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves can have different frequencies (and thus wavelengths), giving rise to various types of radiation such as [[radio waves]], [[microwaves]], [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-rays]], and [[Gamma rays]].\n\n== Quantum mechanical waves ==\n{{Main|Schrödinger equation}}\n{{See also|Wave function}}\n\n=== Schrödinger equation ===\nThe [[Schrödinger equation]] describes the wave-like behavior of particles in [[quantum mechanics]].

Dirac waves accounted for the fine details of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous way. The wave equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter, antimatter, previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed. In the context of quantum field theory, the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin-½ particles.\n\n[[File:Wave packet (dispersion).gif|thumb|A propagating wave packet; in general, the \'\'envelope\'\' of the wave packet moves at a different speed than the constituent waves.<ref name=Fromhold>{{cite book |title = Quantum Mechanics for Applied Physics and Engineering |author = A.T.

This hypothesis was at the basis of [[quantum mechanics]]. Nowadays, this wavelength is called the [[de Broglie wavelength]]. For example, the [[electron]]s in a [[cathode-ray tube|CRT]] display have a de Broglie wavelength of about 10<sup>−13</sup>&nbsp;m.\n\nA wave representing such a particle traveling in the \'\'k\'\'-direction is expressed by the wave function as follows:\n\n:<math>\\psi (\\mathbf{r}, \\, t=0) = A e^{i\\mathbf{k \\cdot r}} , </math>\n\nwhere the wavelength is determined by the [[wave vector]] \'\'\'k\'\'\' as:\n\n:<math> \\lambda = \\frac {2 \\pi}{k} , </math>\n\nand the momentum by:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k} . </math>\n\nHowever, a wave like this with definite wavelength is not localized in space, and so cannot represent a particle localized in space.
