Further \'\'SFX\'\' columns are collected in \'\'Starcombing: columns, essays, reviews and more\'\' (2009), which also includes much other material written since 2000.\n\nDavid Langford has also written columns for several computer magazines, notably \'\'[[8000 Plus]]\'\' (later renamed \'\'[[PCW Plus]]\'\'), which was devoted to the [[Amstrad PCW]] word processor. This column ran, though not continuously, from the first issue in October 1986 to the last, dated Christmas 1996; it was revived in the small-press magazine \'\'PCW Today\'\' from 1997 to 2002, and all the columns are collected as \'\'The Limbo Files\'\' (2009). Langford\'s 1985–1988 "The Disinformation Column" for \'\'[[Apricot File]]\'\' focused on [[Apricot Computers]] systems; these columns are collected as \'\'The Apricot Files\'\' (2007).\n\nA collection of nonfiction and humorous work, \'\'[[Let\'s Hear It for the Deaf Man]]\'\', was published in 1992 by [[NESFA Press]].  This was incorporated into a follow-up collection, consisting of 47 nonfiction pieces and three short stories, and published as \'\'[[The Silence of the Langford]]\'\' in 1996. \'\'[[Up Through an Empty House of Stars]]\'\' (2003) is a further collection of one hundred reviews and essays.\n\nMuch of Langford\'s early book-length publication was futurological in nature. \'\'[[War in 2080: The Future of Military Technology]]\'\', published in 1979, and \'\'[[The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000-3000]]\'\' (1985), jointly written with fellow science fiction author [[Brian Stableford]], are two examples. Both these authors also worked with [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] on \'\'[[The Science in Science Fiction]]\'\' (1982). Within the broader field of popular non-fiction, Langford co-wrote \'\'Facts and Fallacies: a Book of Definitive Mistakes and Misguided Predictions\'\' (1984) with Chris Morgan.\n\nLangford assisted in producing the second edition of \'\'[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]\'\' (1993) and contributed some 80,000 words of articles to \'\'[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]\'\' (1997). He is one of the four chief editors of the third, online edition of \'\'The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\'\' (launched October 2011), and shared this reference work\'s 2012 [[Hugo Award]] for Best Related Work. He has also edited a book of [[John Sladek]]\'s uncollected work, published in 2002 as \'\'Maps: The Uncollected John Sladek\'\'. Langford\'s critical introduction to \'\'Maps\'\' won a [[BSFA Award]] for nonfiction. With [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]], Langford also set up [[Ansible E-ditions]] (now [[Ansible Editions]]) which publishes other [[print-on-demand]] collections of short stories by Sladek and [[David I. Masson]]; essays and review columns by [[Brian Aldiss]], [[Algis Budrys]], [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] and again Sladek; and ebooks of historical interest to [[science fiction fandom]], downloadable at no charge from the [[Trans-Atlantic Fan Fund]] site.<ref name=AE>{{cite web|url=https://ae.ansible.uk|title=Ansible Editions|access-date=22 August 2022}}</ref><ref name=TAFF>{{cite web|url=https://taff.orf.uk|title=Trans-Atlantic Fan Fund site|access-date=22 August 2022}}</ref>\n\nExcluding collections, Langford\'s most recent professionally published book is \'\'The End of Harry Potter?\'\' (2006), an unauthorised companion to the famous series by [[J. K. Rowling]]. The work was published after the publication of the sixth volume in the Harry Potter series, but before publication of the seventh and final volume. It contains information, extracted from the books and from Rowling\'s many public statements, about the [[wizarding world]] and popular theories concerning how the plot will develop in the last book. A revised version was published in the US in March 2007 by Tor Books, and in paperback form in the UK in May 2007. The book was commissioned from Langford by [[Malcolm Edwards]] of [[Orion Books]], who were seeking a book about the Harry Potter series.\n\nSince 2011 he has devoted most of his time to \'\'Ansible\'\', Ansible Editions and \'\'[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]\'\'.\n\nHe has been a guest of honour at [[Boskone (convention)|Boskone]], [[Eastercon]] twice, [[Finncon]], [[Microcon]] three times, [[Minicon]] (see [[List of past Minicons]]), [[Novacon]], [[OryCon]] twice, [[Picocon]] several times, and [[Worldcon]] (see [[List of Worldcons]]).\n\n==Awards==\nLangford holds the all-time record for most [[Hugo Award]]s, with a total of 29 wins.{{efn|This is a joint record shared with [[Charles N.
