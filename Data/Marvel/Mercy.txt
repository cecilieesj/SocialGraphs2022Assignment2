It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. [[John Locke]] defined it as "the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it."<ref>Locke, John. \'\'Second Treatise on Civil Government\'\', (C.B MacPherson, ed.), Indianapolis, Indiana. Hackett, 1980, §§ 159-160</ref> The U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] explained that "The very nature of clemency is that it is grounded solely in the will of the dispenser of clemency. He need give no reasons for granting it or for denying it."<ref>\'\'In re Sapp\'\', 118 F. 3d 460, 465 (6th Cir. 1997)</ref>\n\n==Religions==\nThe concept of a merciful God appears in various religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, and care for the sick and [[Works of Mercy]].\n\n===Christianity===\nHebrews 4:16 says, "So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help."<ref>Hebrews 4:16, NAB</ref> Grace and mercy are similar in that both are free gifts of God and both are dispensed absent any merit on the part of the recipient. Grace is the favor of God, a divine assistance. Grace is what one receives that they do not deserve while mercy is what one receives when they do \'\'not\'\' get that which they deserve.<ref>[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2014/03/17/what-is-the-difference-between-mercy-and-grace/ Wellman, Jack.

This is quoted by the Apostle Paul in Romans 15:11 to show that God has now fulfilled this prophecy and promise through Jesus Christ, who has been merciful in giving his life as a sacrifice for his people, both Jew and gentile. {{Bibleref2|1 Peter|2:9-10|KJV}} reads:\n{{quote|But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.}}\n\nThis devotional element of mercy as part of the Christian tradition was echoed by [[Saint Augustine]] who called mercy "ever ancient, ever new".<ref name=Mauriello149 >\'\'Mercies Remembered\'\' by Matthew R Mauriello 2011 {{ISBN|1-61215-005-5}} page 149-160</ref><ref>[[Augustine]], \'\'[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]\'\', Book X, 27</ref> The [[Works of Mercy]] (seven corporal and seven spiritual works) are part of the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions.<ref name=Apostoli105 />\n\n====Roman Catholicism====\n{{see also|Divine Mercy}}\n[[File:Kazimirowski Eugeniusz, Divine Mercy, 1934.jpg|thumb|180px|The first \'\'[[Divine Mercy image]]\'\' (circa 1934) painted according to the apparitions of [[Faustina Kowalska]] by [[Eugene Kazimierowski]].

The figure of the father is analogous to God as Father, who goes beyond the requirements of justice to welcome his son with compassion.\n\nThe [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] emphasizes the importance of the [[Works of Mercy]] (item 2447) and in [[Roman Catholic]] teachings, the mercy of God flows through the work of the Holy Spirit.<ref name=Apostoli105 >\'\'We Believe in the Holy Spirit\'\' by Andrew Apostoli 2002 {{ISBN|1-931709-31-9}} pages 105-107</ref><ref name=Catechism2447 >[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm#2447 Vatican website Catechism item 2447]</ref> Roman [[Catholic liturgy]] includes frequent references to mercy, e.g., as in \'\'[[Kyrie|Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison]]\'\': Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08714a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: \'\'Kyrie Eleison\'\']</ref>\n\nMercy has also been an important subject of Christian [[iconography]].

Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you." (Isaiah 49:13-15) Also: "It is good to pray and fast, to be merciful and just." (Tobit 12:8)\n\nWhen [[David]], because of his sin, was told to choose between a three-year famine, pursuit by his enemies for three months, or a three-day pestilence, he chose the pestilence saying, "Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful; but let me not fall by the hand of man."<ref>2 Samuel 24:14, NAB</ref> Psalm 103:8 praises God for his mercy.\n\n===Other religions and beliefs===\n[[Kwan Yin]] the bodhisattva of mercy and compassion, is one of the best known and most venerated [[Bodhisattva]] in Asia.<ref>\'\'Guan Yin: goddess of compassion\'\' by Kok Kiang Koh 2004 {{ISBN|981-229-379-5}} pages 6-8</ref>\n\n[[Karuṇā]] (often translated as "compassion") is part of the beliefs of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].
