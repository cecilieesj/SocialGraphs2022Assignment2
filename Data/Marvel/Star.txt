The [[List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs|nearest star]] to [[Earth]] is the [[Sun]]. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at [[night sky|night]], but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as [[fixed stars|fixed]] points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorised into [[constellation]]s and [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]], and many of the brightest stars have [[proper name]]s. [[Astronomer]]s have assembled [[star catalogue]]s that identify the known stars and provide standardized [[stellar designation]]s. The [[observable universe]] contains an estimated {{val|e=22}} to {{val|e=24}} stars. Still, most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]].\n\nA star\'s life [[star formation|begins]] with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a gaseous [[nebula]] of material composed primarily of [[hydrogen]], along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. Its [[stellar mass|total mass]] is the main factor determining its [[stellar evolution|evolution]] and eventual fate. A star shines for [[main sequence|most of its active life]] due to the [[thermonuclear fusion]] of hydrogen into [[helium]] in its core. This process releases energy that traverses the star\'s interior and [[radiation|radiates]] into [[outer space]]. At the end of a star\'s lifetime, its core becomes a [[stellar remnant]]: a [[white dwarf]], a [[neutron star]], or—if it is sufficiently massive—a [[black hole]].\n\n[[Stellar nucleosynthesis]] in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring [[chemical element]]s heavier than [[lithium]]. [[Stellar mass loss]] or [[supernova]] explosions return chemically enriched material to the [[interstellar medium]]. These elements are then recycled into new stars. Astronomers can determine stellar properties—including mass, age, [[metallicity]] (chemical composition), [[variable star|variability]], [[distance (astronomy)|distance]], and motion through [[space]]—by carrying out observations of a star\'s [[apparent magnitude|apparent brightness]], [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]], and [[astrometry|changes in its position in the sky]] over time.\n\nStars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in the case of [[planetary system]]s and [[star system]]s with [[binary star|two]] or [[star system#Multiple star systems|more]] stars. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a [[star cluster]] or a galaxy.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word "star" ultimately derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root "h₂stḗr" also meaning star, but further analyzable as h₂eh₁s- ("to burn", also the source of the word "ash") + -tēr (agentive suffix). Compare [[Latin]] stella, [[Greek language|Greek]] aster, [[German language|German]] Stern. Some scholars believe the word is a borrowing from [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] "istar" (venus), however some doubt that suggestion. Star is cognate (shares the same root) with the following words: [[asterisk]], [[asteroid]], [[wikt:astral|astral]], [[constellation]], [[Esther]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |date=2001–2022 |title=*ster- (2) |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/*ster-#etymonline_v_52592 |access-date=28 February 2022 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>\n\n==Observation history==\n{{seealso|Stars in astrology}}\n[[File:Dibuix de Leo.png|thumb|People have interpreted patterns and images in the stars since ancient times.<ref name="forbes" /> This 1690 depiction of the constellation of [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], the lion, is by [[Johannes Hevelius]].<ref>{{cite book\n | first=Johannis | last=Hevelius | date=1690\n | title=Firmamentum Sobiescianum, sive Uranographia\n | location=Gdansk}}</ref>]]\n\nHistorically, stars have been important to [[civilization]]s throughout the world.

Since the product of the Newtonian gravitational constant and solar mass\ntogether (GM<sub>⊙</sub>) has been determined to much greater precision, the IAU defined the \'\'nominal\'\' solar mass parameter to be:\n\n:{|\n| nominal solar mass parameter:\n| \'\'GM\'\'<sub>⊙</sub> = {{nowrap|1.3271244 × 10<sup>20</sup> m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−2</sup>}} <ref name="Prsa16"/>\n|}\n\nThe nominal solar mass parameter can be combined with the most recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian gravitational constant G to derive the solar mass to be approximately 1.9885 × 10<sup>30</sup> kg. Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.\n\nLarge lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the [[Semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]] of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the [[astronomical unit]]—approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150&nbsp;million km or approximately 93&nbsp;million miles).

The Sun is expected to live 10&nbsp;billion (10<sup>10</sup>) years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than 0.25 {{Solar mass}}, called [[red dwarf]]s, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about 1 {{Solar mass}} can only fuse about 10% of their mass. The combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) years; the most extreme of 0.08 {{Solar mass}} will last for about 12&nbsp;trillion years.

In a red giant of up to 2.25 {{Solar mass}}, the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to [[helium fusion]].

The star then follows an evolutionary path called the [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) that parallels the other described red-giant phase, but with a higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate. During the AGB phase, stars undergo [[thermal pulse]]s due to instabilities in the core of the star. In these thermal pulses, the luminosity of the star [[variable star|varies]] and matter is ejected from the star\'s atmosphere, ultimately forming a planetary nebula. As much as 50 to 70% of a star\'s mass can be ejected in this [[stellar mass loss|mass loss]] process. Because energy transport in an AGB star is primarily by [[convection]], this ejected material is enriched with the fusion products [[dredge-up|dredged up]] from the core.

The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure [[gradient]] within the star. The [[pressure gradient]] is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 10<sup>7</sup> K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.<ref name="hansen">{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Carl J. |last2=Kawaler |first2=Steven D. |last3=Trimble |first3=Virginia |pages=[https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-1-4419-9110-2/page/n44 32]–33 |title=Stellar Interiors |url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-1-4419-9110-2 |publisher=Springer |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-387-20089-7}}</ref><ref name="Schwarzschild">{{cite book|title=Structure and Evolution of the Stars|last=Schwarzschild|first=Martin|date=1958|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-08044-4}}<!-- Book republished by Dover as ISBN 0-486-61479-4, but ISBN in the cite book template is the one as published by Prin.

These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 {{Solar mass}}, fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] helium core.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://aether.lbl.gov/www/tour/elements/stellar/stellar_a.html |title= Formation of the High Mass Elements |publisher= Smoot Group |access-date= 2006-07-11}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will maintain an energy balance of [[thermal equilibrium]]. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.<ref name="HuangYu1998">{{cite book|author1=R. Q. Huang|author2=K. N.

In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. Where this is not the case, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a [[convection zone]]. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.<ref name="Schwarzschild" />\n\nThe occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star\'s mass. Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers.<ref name="imagine">{{cite web |date= 2006-09-01 |url= http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/stars.html |title= What is a Star? |publisher= NASA |access-date= 2006-07-11}}</ref> Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 {{Solar mass}} are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core.<ref name="late stages" /> For most stars the convective zones will vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.<ref name="Schwarzschild" />\n\n[[File:Sun parts big.jpg|thumb|A cross-section of the [[Sun]]]]\nThe photosphere is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer.
