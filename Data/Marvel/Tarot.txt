From their Italian roots, tarot playing cards spread to most of Europe evolving into a family of games that includes German [[Grosstarok]] and more recent games such as [[French Tarot]] and Austrian [[Königrufen]] which are still played today. In the late 18th century, French [[occultist]]s began to make elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims about their history and meaning, leading to the emergence of custom decks for use in [[divination]] via [[tarot card reading]] and [[cartomancy]].{{sfn|Decker|Depaulis|Dummett|1996|p=ix}} Thus there are two distinct types of tarot pack: those used for playing games and those used for divination. However, some older patterns, such as the [[Tarot de Marseille]], originally intended for playing card games, have also been used for cartomancy.\n\nLike the common playing cards, tarot has four [[suit (cards)|suits]] which vary by region: French suits in Northern Europe, Latin suits in Southern Europe. Each suit has 14 cards: ten [[Pip (counting)|pip cards]] numbering from one (or [[Ace]]) to ten, and four [[face card]]s ([[King (playing card)|King]], [[Queen (playing card)|Queen]], [[Knight (playing card)|Knight]], and [[Jack (playing card)|Jack/Knave/Page]]).  In addition, the tarot has a separate 21-card [[trump (card games)|trump]] suit and a single card known as [[The Fool (tarot card)|the Fool]]. Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit.<ref name="DummettGame">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqm1AAAAIAAJ |title=The game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City |isbn=9780715610145 |last1=Dummett |first1=Michael A.

However, scholarly research has demonstrated that tarot cards were invented in northern Italy in the mid-15th century and confirmed that there is no historical evidence of the use of tarot cards for divination until the late 18th century.<ref name="DummettGame"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Re-Symbolization of the Self: Human Development and Tarot Hermeneutic|last=Semetsky|first=Inna|publisher=Sense Publishers|year=2011|isbn=978-94-6091-421-8|location=Rotterdam|pages=33}}</ref> In the occult tradition, tarot cards are referred to as \'arcana\'; with the Fool and 21 trumps being termed the [[Major Arcana]] and the suit cards the [[Minor Arcana]]. However, these terms are not used by players of [[tarot card games]].\n\nTarot cards, then known as \'\'tarocchi\'\', first appeared in [[Ferrara]] and [[Milan]] in northern Italy, with a Fool and 21 trumps (then called \'\'[[trionfi (cards)|trionfi]]\'\' being added to the standard Italian pack of four suits: [[batons (suit)|batons]], [[coins (suit)|coins]], [[cups (suit)|cups]] and [[swords (suit)|swords]]. Scholarship has established that the early European cards were probably based on the Egyptian Mamluk deck which followed the invention of paper from Asia into Western Europe and was invented in or before the 14th century (see [[Playing Card]] - Egypt and following sections). By the late 1300\'s Europeans were producing their own cards, the earliest patterns being based on the Mamluk deck but with variations to the [[suit symbol]]s and [[court card]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tarot-cary-collection-ita-sheet-3s-c1500..jpg|thumb|Milanese \'\'tarocchi\'\', {{circa}} 1500]]\n\nPlaying cards first entered Europe in the late 14th century, but the origin is unknown. The first records date to 1367 in Berne and they appear to have spread very rapidly across the whole of Europe, as may be seen from the records, mainly of card games being banned.<ref>Peter F.

These suits are still used in traditional [[Italian playing cards|Italian]], [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] playing card decks, and are also used in modern (occult) tarot divination cards that first appeared in the late 18th century.<ref>[[Donald Laycock]] in \'\'Skeptical—a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal\'\', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7316-5794-2}}, p. 67</ref>\n\nThe first documented tarot decks were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in [[Milan]], [[Ferrara]], [[Florence]] and [[Bologna]] when additional trump cards with allegorical [[illustration]]s were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called \'\'carte da trionfi\'\', triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as [[trionfi (cards)|trionfi]], which became "trumps" in English. The earliest documentation of \'\'trionfi\'\' is found in a written statement in the court records of [[Florence]], in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|author-link=Franco Pratesi|title=In Search of Tarot Sources|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2012|volume=41|issue=2|page=100}}</ref><ref>[[Pratesi, Franco]].

He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the [[List of Roman deities|Roman gods]] and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as "trumps" since in 1449 Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a \'\'novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus\'\', or "a new and exquisite kind of triumphs".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|author-link=Franco Pratesi|title=Italian Cards - New Discoveries|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1989|volume=18|issue=1, 2|pages=28–32, 33–38}}</ref> Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the [[Sola Busca tarot|Sola-Busca]] and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.<ref name="DummettGame"/>\n\nIn [[Florence]], an expanded deck called \'\'[[Minchiate]]\'\' was used.

It was only after the invention of the [[printing press]] that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the [[Italian Wars]].

Regional tarot games—often known as \'\'tarock\'\', \'\'tarok\'\', or \'\'tarokk\'\'—are widely played in central Europe within the borders of the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]].\n\n{{anchor|Italian}}\n===Italian-suited decks===\n[[File:Tarot Piedmont 0.jpg|thumb|[[Tarocco Piemontese]]: the \'\'Fool\'\' card]]\n\nThese were the oldest form of tarot deck to be made, being first devised in the 15th century in northern Italy. Three decks of this category are still used to play certain games:\n* The [[Tarocco Piemontese]] consists of the four suits of swords, batons, cups and coins, each headed by a king, queen, cavalier and jack, followed by the [[pip cards]] for a total of 78 cards. Trump 20 outranks 21 in most games and the Fool is numbered 0 despite not being a trump.\n* The [[Swiss 1JJ Tarot]] is similar, but replaces the Pope with Jupiter, the Popess with Juno, and the Angel with the Judgement. The trumps rank in numerical order and the Tower is known as the House of God. The cards are not reversible like the Tarocco Piemontese.\n* The [[Tarocco Bolognese]] omits numeral cards two to five in plain suits, leaving it with 62 cards, and has somewhat different trumps, not all of which are numbered and four of which are equal in rank. It has a different graphical design than the two above as it was not derived from the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].\n\n{{anchor|Portuguese}}\n===Italo-Portuguese-suited deck===\nThe [[Tarocco Siciliano]] is the only deck to use the so-called Portuguese suit system which uses Spanish pips but intersects them like Italian pips.<ref>[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-12.html Tarocco Siciliano, early form] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]] website. Retrieved 26 July 2015.</ref> Some of the trumps are different such as the lowest trump, \'\'Miseria\'\' (destitution). It omits the Two and Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and cups: it thus has 64 cards but the ace of coins is not used, being the bearer of the former [[stamp tax]]. The cards are quite small and not reversible.[[#cite note-8|<sup>[9]</sup>]]\n{{anchor|Italian}}\n\n{{anchor|French}}\n===French-suited decks===\nThe illustrations of French-suited tarot trumps depart considerably from the older Italian-suited design, abandoning the Renaissance allegorical motifs. With the exception of novelty decks, French-suited tarot cards are almost exclusively used for [[card games]]. The first generation of French-suited tarots depicted scenes of animals on the trumps and were thus called "[[Tiertarock]]" (\'Tier\' being German for \'animal\') appeared around 1740. Around 1800, a greater variety of decks were produced, mostly with [[genre art]] or [[veduta]]. The German states used to produce a variety of 78-card tarot packs, originally using Italian suits, but later switching to French suited cards; some were imported to France. Today, there are only two: both are French-suited patterns of [[Cego]] packs - the Cego Adler pack manufactured by [[ASS Altenburger]] and one with genre scenes by [[F.X. Schmid]], which may reflect the mainstream German cards of the 19th century. Current French-suited tarot decks come in these patterns:\n\n* \'\'[[Industrie und Glück]]\'\' – the \'\'Industrie und Glück\'\' ("Diligence and Fortune"{{efn|"Diligence and Fortune" is the contemporary meaning of the phrase \'\'Industrie und Glück\'\'. See, for example, Placardi, Carl (1766). \'\'Das Kaiserliche Sprach- und Wörterbuch\'\', Cölln am Rhein: Metternich, pp. 72 and 83.}}) genre art tarock deck of Central Europe uses Roman numerals for the trumps. It is sold with 54 cards; the 5 to 10 of the red suits and the 1 to 6 of the black suits are removed. There are 3 patterns – Types A, B and C – of which Type C has become the standard, whereas Types B and C appear in limited editions or specials.\n*\'\'[[Tarot Nouveau]]\'\' – also called the \'\'Tarot Bourgeois\'\' – has a 78-card pack. It is commonly used for tarot games in France and for [[Danish Tarok]] in Denmark. It is also sometimes used in Germany to play [[Cego]]. Its genre art trumps use Arabic numerals in corner indices.\n* \'\'[[Adler-Cego]]\'\' – this is an animal tarot that is used in the [[Rhine Rift Valley|Upper Rhine valley]] and neighbouring mountain regions such as the [[Black Forest]] or the [[Vosges]] It has 54 cards organized in the same fashion as the \'\'Industrie und Glück\'\' packs. Its trumps use Arabic numerals but within centered indices.\n* \'\'[[Black Forest Cego|Schmid-Cego]]\'\' - this pack by [[F.X. Schmid]] is of the [[Bourgeois Tarot]] type and has [[genre scene]]s similar to those of the \'\'Tarot Nouveau\'\', but the Arabic numerals are centred as in the Adler-Cego pack.\n\n<gallery class="center">\nFile:Tiertarock Mannheim ca 1778.jpg|Example of 18th century "[[Tiertarock]]"\nFile:Salzburg Spielkarten c1840.jpg|Salzburg veduta trumps, circa 1840\nFile:Taroky trul.JPG|\'\'[[Industrie und Glück]]\'\' Tarock trumps\nFile:Cego Animal Tarot Cards - Top 4 Trumps - IMG 7814.jpg|Adler [[Cego]] trumps\nFile:Cego Bourgeois Tarot - Top 4 Trumps - IMG 7812.jpg|Cego [[Bourgeois Tarot]]\nFile:Oudlers1910.PNG|[[Tarot Nouveau]] (aka [[Bourgeois Tarot]]) trumps circa 1910\n</gallery>\n\n{{anchor|German}}\n\n=== German \'Tarock\' cards ===\nFrom the late 18th century, the south German states manufactured German-suited packs labelled \'Taroc\', \'Tarock\' or \'Deutsch-Tarok\'. Today these survive as \'Schafkopf/Tarock\' packs of the [[Bavaria]]n and [[Franconia]]n pattern. These are not true tarot packs, but standard 36-card [[German playing cards|German-suited decks]] for games like [[German Tarok]], [[Bauerntarock]], [[Württemberg Tarock]] and [[Bavarian Tarock]]. Until the 1980s there were also Tarock packs in the [[Württemberg]] pattern. There are 36 cards; the [[pip card]]s ranging from 6 to 10, Under Knave (\'\'[[Unter (playing card)|Unter]]\'\'), Over Knave (\'\'[[Ober (playing card)|Ober]]\'\'), King, and Ace. These use [[Ace-Ten games|Ace-Ten ranking]], like [[Klaverjas]], where Ace is the highest followed by 10, King, Ober, Unter, then 9 to 6. The heart suit is the default trump suit.<ref name="DummettGame"/> The Bavarian pack is also used to play [[Schafkopf]] by excluding the Sixes.\n\n<gallery class="center">\nFile:Württembergischer Tarock.jpg|[[Württemberg Tarock]] cards\nFile:Schafkopf Tarock bayerisches Bild.jpg|Bavarian [[Schafkopf]]/[[Bavarian Tarock|Tarock]] cards\n</gallery>\n\n{{anchor|Spanish}}\n===Spanish-suited decks===\n[[Spanish-suited playing cards]] have four suits, and a deck is usually made up of 40 or 48 cards (or even up to 52 in the oldest versions). It is categorized as a Latin-suited deck and has strong similarities with the Italian-suited deck as both were derived directly from the Mamluk cards. The oldest mentions date back to the 14th century making it one of the oldest in Europe.\n\nSpanish-suited cards are used in Spain, southern Italy, parts of France, Hispanic America, North Africa, and the Philippines. The four suits are bastos (clubs), oros (literally "golds", that is, golden coins), copas (cups) and espadas (swords). However, the suits vary in style depending on the region and time. The following patterns (and their suits) are derived from the oldest Spanish-suited deck: the castillian pattern, the Spanish national pattern (old Catalan pattern), the new Catalan pattern, Franco-Spanish pattern (Suit Piacentine and Suit Romagnole), Madrid pattern (Suit Sicilian and Suit Neapolitan), Sardinian pattern and the extinct Portuguese pattern.\n\nLike the Italian-suited tarot, the deck is used for both game playing and cartomancy. The Spanish deck has been widely considered to be part of the occult in many Latin American countries, yet they continue to be used widely for card games and gambling, especially in Spain.\n\n<gallery class="center">\nFile:Spanish deck Fournier.jpg|Castillian Suit cards\nFile:Spanish deck printed in Valencia, in 1778.jpg|Spanish deck printed in Valencia\nFile:Spanish National pattern.png|Spanish National pattern\nFile:Carte piacentine al completo.jpg|Piacentine Suit cards\nFile:Carte sarde.jpg|Sardinian Suit Cards\nFile:うんすんカルタ.png|Unsun karuta deck, from Japan, evolved from the Extinct Portuguese Pattern\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Card reading==\n{{Main article|Tarot card reading}}\n[[File:The Major Arcana by Roberto Viesi.jpg|thumb|Deck of the 22 [[Major Arcana]] cards inspired by the Tarot of Marseilles, but with the author\'s graphic style]]\n\nThe earliest evidence of a tarot deck used for [[cartomancy]] comes from an anonymous manuscript from around 1750 which documents rudimentary divinatory meanings for the cards of the [[Tarocco Bolognese]].<ref name=Pratesi>{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|author-link=Franco Pratesi|title=Italian Cards: New Discoveries, no. 9|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1989|volume=17|issue=4|pages=136–145}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=Tarot Cartomancy in Bologna|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2003|volume=32|issue=2|pages=79–88}}</ref> The popularization of esoteric tarot started with [[Antoine Court de Gébelin|Antoine Court]] and [[Etteilla|Jean-Baptiste Alliette]] (Etteilla) in Paris during the 1780s, using the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].<ref name=Jensen>{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=K.
