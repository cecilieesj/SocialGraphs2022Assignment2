Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The [[ecotone]] (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the [[tree line]] or timberline. The tundra soil is rich in [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].<ref name="berkeley" /> The soil also contains large amounts of biomass and decomposed biomass that has been stored as methane and carbon dioxide in the [[permafrost]], making the tundra soil a [[carbon sink]]. As global warming heats the ecosystem and causes soil thawing, the [[permafrost carbon cycle]] accelerates and releases much of these soil-contained greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, creating [[Climate change feedback|a feedback cycle]] that increases climate change.\n\n== Arctic == <!-- This section is linked from [[Reindeer]] -->\n{{anchor|Arctic tundra}}\n{{see also|Arctic vegetation}}\nArctic tundra occurs in the far [[Northern Hemisphere]], north of the [[taiga]] belt. The word "tundra" usually refers only to the areas where the subsoil is [[permafrost]], or permanently frozen soil. (It may also refer to the treeless plain in general so that northern [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]] would be included.) Permafrost tundra includes vast areas of northern Russia and Canada.<ref name="berkeley"/> The polar tundra is home to several peoples who are mostly nomadic reindeer herders, such as the [[Nganasan people|Nganasan]] and [[Nenet people|Nenets]] in the permafrost area (and the [[Sami people|Sami]] in [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]]).\n[[File:Tundra in Siberia.jpg|thumb|Tundra in [[Siberia]]]]\n\nArctic tundra contains areas of stark landscape and is frozen for much of the year. The soil there is frozen from {{convert|25|to|90|cm|0|abbr=on}} down, making it impossible for trees to grow. Instead, bare and sometimes rocky land can only support certain kinds of [[Arctic vegetation]], low-growing plants such as moss, heath ([[Ericaceae]] varieties such as [[crowberry]] and [[Arctostaphylos alpina|black bearberry]]), and [[lichen]].\n\nThere are two main seasons, winter and summer, in the polar tundra areas. During the winter it is very cold, dark, and windy with the average temperature around {{convert|-28|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, sometimes dipping as low as {{convert|-50|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. However, extreme cold temperatures on the tundra do not drop as low as those experienced in taiga areas further south (for example, Russia\'s and Canada\'s lowest temperatures were recorded in locations south of the tree line). During the summer, temperatures rise somewhat, and the top layer of seasonally-frozen soil melts, leaving the ground very soggy. The tundra is covered in marshes, lakes, bogs, and streams during the warm months. Generally daytime temperatures during the summer rise to about {{convert|12|°C|°F|abbr=on}} but can often drop to {{convert|3|°C|°F|abbr=on}} or even below freezing. Arctic tundras are sometimes the subject of [[habitat conservation]] programs. In Canada and Russia, many of these areas are protected through a national [[Biodiversity Action Plan]].\n\n[[File:Vontut National Park.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vuntut National Park]] in Canada]]\nTundra tends to be windy, with winds often blowing upwards of {{convert|50|-|100|kph|mph|-1|abbr=on}}. However, it is desert-like, with only about {{convert|150|-|250|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation falling per year (the summer is typically the season of maximum precipitation). Although precipitation is light, evaporation is also relatively minimal. During the summer, the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce, but because the ground below this is frozen, the water cannot sink any lower, so the water forms the lakes and marshes found during the summer months. There is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain. Research in Alaska has shown fire-event return intervals (FRIs) that typically vary from 150 to 200 years, with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter highland areas.<ref>{{cite journal|author2=Melissa L.

Most of Antarctica is too cold and dry to support vegetation, and most of the continent is covered by ice fields. However, some portions of the continent, particularly the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], have areas of rocky soil that support plant life. The flora presently consists of around 300–400 species of lichens, 100 mosses, 25 [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algae species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica\'s two flowering plant species, the [[Antarctic hair grass]] (\'\'Deschampsia antarctica\'\') and [[Antarctic pearlwort]] (\'\'Colobanthus quitensis\'\'), are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web |title=Terrestrial Plants |work=British Antarctic Survey: About Antarctica |url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/ |access-date=2006-03-05}}</ref>\nIn contrast with the Arctic tundra, the Antarctic tundra lacks a large mammal fauna, mostly due to its physical isolation from the other continents. Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals and penguins, inhabit areas near the shore, and some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands.
