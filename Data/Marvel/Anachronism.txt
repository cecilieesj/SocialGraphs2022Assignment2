A 17th-century painting by [[Cesare Gennari]]]]\n\nAn \'\'\'anachronism\'\'\' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνά}} {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}}, \'against\' and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|khronos}}, \'time\') is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a [[juxtaposition]] of people, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period that is placed outside its proper temporal domain. (An example of that would be films including non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and prehistoric human beings living side by side, but they were, in reality, millions of years apart.)\n\nAn anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used intentionally for purposes of rhetoric, propaganda, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, terminology and language, customs and attitudes, or even fashions between different historical periods and eras.\n\n==Types== \n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2020}}\n[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The \'\'[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]\'\' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar\'s clothing of the book\'s time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle.]]\n[[Image:Brian_Bóruma_mac_Cennétig_(1723)_(crop).jpg|thumb|upright|1723 depiction of the Irish High King [[Brian Boru]] (died 1014) showing him wearing plate armor (developed in the 15th century) and holding a [[coat of arms]] (only introduced after the [[Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion]]). In the background is the [[green harp flag]] (first used in 1642) and the [[Comerford Crown]], which dates from the [[Bronze Age]].]]\n\n=== Parachronism <!-- \'Parachronism\' redirects here-->===\nA \'\'\'parachronism\'\'\'<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παρά}}, "on the side", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).\n\nThis may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion or idioms.\n\nExamples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm), or a businessman in 2006 wearing late 19th century clothing. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era\'s state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era—with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.\n\n=== Prochronism <!-- \'Prochronism\' redirects here-->===\nA \'\'\'prochronism\'\'\'<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρό}}, "before", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time. A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.\n\nThe well-known stories of the \'\'[[One Thousand and One Nights]]\'\' contain a manifest prochronism: in the [[frame story]], the tales are narrated to King  [[Shahryār]], presented as a member of the Persian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Dynasty]], by his wife [[Scheherazade]] - yet many of the stories she tells relate to the historical [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Ja\'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]], and his contemporary the famous poet [[Abu Nuwas]], all of whom lived some 200 years after the fall of the Sassanids.\n\n===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===\nThe intentional use of older cultural artifacts may be regarded by some as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]] or write with a [[quill]]. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.\n\n== Politically motivated anachronism ==\nWorks of art and literature promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause may use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is, or otherwise intentionally blur the distinctions between past and present. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]—two leaders in Romania\'s 16th-century history—with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s: anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made.{{fact|date=August 2021}} The Russian artist [[Vasily Vereshchagin]], in his painting \'\'[[Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English]]\'\' (c.1884), depicts the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], when mutineers were executed by being [[Blowing from a gun|blown from guns]]. In order to make the argument that the method of execution would again be utilized by the British if another rebellion broke out in India, Vereshchagin depicted the British soldiers conducting the executions in late 19th-century uniforms.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Art in December: M.

Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. Anachronisms may be the unintentional result of ignorance, or may be a deliberate aesthetic choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|access-date=2014-06-11}}</ref> \n\nSir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: "It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in."<ref>{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |author-link=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}</ref> However, as fashions, conventions and technologies move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. "Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; "Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out \'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!\' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker."<ref>Grafton 1990, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIt is only since the beginning of the 19th century that anachronistic deviations from historical reality have jarred on a general audience. [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote: \n{{quote|All medieval narratives about the past are ... lacking in a sense of period.... It was known that [[Adam]] went naked till he fell. After that, [medieval people] pictured the whole past in terms of their own age. So indeed did the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]].

It is doubtful whether the sense of period is much older than the [[Waverley novels]]. It is hardly present in [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]]. [[Horace Walpole|Walpole]]\'s \'\'[[The Castle of Otranto|Otranto]]\'\', which would not now deceive schoolchildren, could hope, not quite vainly, to deceive the public of 1765.

Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]\'s \'\'[[The Guns of the South]]\'\' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.\n\n== In academia ==\nIn historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}</ref> [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |author-link=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}</ref> Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship\'s use of \'\'[[translatio imperii]]\'\', first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\nThe use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Detection of forgery==\nThe ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. [[Anthony Grafton]] discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], of [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614), and of [[Richard August Reitzenstein|Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the "[[Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]]", through – among other techniques – the recognition of anachronisms.<ref>Grafton 1990, pp. 75–98.</ref> The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of [[diplomatics]], the critical analysis of the forms and language of documents, developed by the [[Maurist]] scholar [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707) and his successors [[René-Prosper Tassin]] (1697–1777) and [[Charles-François Toustain]] (1700–1754). The philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:\n{{quote|The falsehood of a writing will often be detected, by its making direct mention of, or allusions more or less indirect to, some fact posterior to the date which it bears. ... \'\'The mention of posterior facts;\'\' – first indication of forgery.<br>\nIn a living language there are always variations in words, in the meaning of words, in the construction of phrases, in the manner of spelling, which may detect the age of a writing, and lead to legitimate suspicions of forgery. ... \'\'The use of words not used till after the date of the writing;\'\' – second indication of forgery.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |author-link=Jeremy Bentham |title=A Treatise on Judicial Evidence |editor-first=Étienne |editor-last=Dumont |editor-link=Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont |place=London |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock and Joy |year=1825 |page=[https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonjudi00dumogoog/page/n160 140] |url=https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonjudi00dumogoog }}</ref>}}\n\nExamples are:\n* The exposure by [[Lorenzo Valla]] in 1440 of the so-called [[Donation of Constantine]], a decree purportedly issued by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] in either 315 or 317 AD, as a later forgery, depended to a considerable degree on the identification of anachronisms, such as references to the city of [[Constantinople]] (a name not in fact bestowed until 330 AD).\n* A large number of apparent [[anachronisms in the Book of Mormon]] have served to convince critics that the book was written in the 19th century, and not, as its adherents claim, in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America.\n* The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] terminology demonstrates that the purported "[[Franklin Prophecy]]" (attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], who died in 1790) is a forgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Myth: The Franklin "Prophecy" |publisher=Adl.org |access-date=2013-02-01}}</ref>\n* The "[[William Lynch speech]]", an address, supposedly delivered in 1712, on the control of slaves in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], is now considered to be a 20th-century forgery, partly on account of its use of anachronistic terms such as "program" and "refueling".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch\'s Letter Real? |last=Cobb |first=W.
