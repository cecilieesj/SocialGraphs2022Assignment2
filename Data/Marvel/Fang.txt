They are generally used to hold or swiftly kill prey, such as in large cats. Omnivorous animals, such as [[bear]]s, use their fangs when hunting fish or other prey, but they are not needed for consuming fruit. Some apes also have fangs, which they use for threats and fighting. However, the relatively short canines of humans are not considered to be fangs.\n\n==Fangs in religion, mythology and legend==\nCertain mythological and legendary creatures such as [[dragon]]s, [[gargoyle]]s and [[yaksha]]s are commonly depicted with prominent fangs. The fangs of [[vampire]]s are one of their defining characteristics.\n\nThe iconographic representation of some Hindu deities include fangs, to symbolize the ability to hunt and kill. Two examples are fierce warrior goddess [[Chamunda]] and god of death [[Yama]] in some iconographic representations. Fangs are also common among guardian figures such as Verupaksha in Buddhism art in China and East Asia,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Asa Simon Mittman|author2=Peter J.
