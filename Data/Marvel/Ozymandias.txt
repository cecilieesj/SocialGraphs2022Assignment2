It was first published in the 11 January 1818 issue of \'\'[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]\'\'{{sfn|Glirastes|1818|p=24}} of [[London]].\nThe poem was included the following year in Shelley\'s collection \'\'[[Rosalind and Helen|Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; with Other Poems]],\'\'<ref name="Shelley1876" /> and in a posthumous compilation of his poems published in 1826.{{sfn|Shelley|1826|p=100}}\n\nShelley wrote the poem in friendly competition with his friend and fellow poet [[Horace Smith (poet)|Horace Smith]] (1779–1849), who also wrote [[Ozymandias (Smith)|a sonnet on the same topic with the same title]]. The poem explores the fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion.\n\n== Origin ==\n[[File:Colossal bust of Ramesses II, the &#039;Younger Memnon&#039;.jpg|thumb|The statue fragment of Ramesses II, the [[Younger Memnon]], in the British Museum.]]\nIn antiquity, \'\'Ozymandias\'\' was a Greek name for the pharaoh [[Ramesses II]] (r. 1279–1213 BC), derived from a part of his [[Throne name (Ancient Egypt)|throne name]], \'\'Usermaatre\'\'. In 1817, Shelley began writing the poem "Ozymandias", after the [[British Museum]] acquired the [[Younger Memnon]], a head-and-torso fragment of a statue of Ramesses II, which dated from the 13th century BC. Earlier, in 1816, the Italian archeologist [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]] had removed the {{convert|7.25|ST|t kg|adj=on}} statue fragment from the [[Ramesseum]], the [[mortuary temple]] of Ramesses II at Thebes, Egypt. The reputation of the statue fragment preceded its arrival to Western Europe; after his [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian expedition in 1798]], Napoleon Bonaparte had failed to acquire the Younger Memnon for France.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/object/statue-of-ramesses-ii-the-younger-memnon| title = Ancient Egypt.

Typically, Shelley published his literary works either anonymously or pseudonymously, under the name "Glirastes", a Graeco-Latin name created by combining the Latin \'\'glīs\'\' ("[[dormouse]]") with the Greek suffix ἐραστής (\'\'erastēs\'\', "lover");{{sfn|Carter|2018}} the Glirastes name referred to his wife, [[Mary Shelley]], whom he nicknamed "dormouse".{{sfn|Everest|Matthews|2014|p=307}}\n\n==Writing, publication and text==\n===Publication history===\nThe banker and political writer [[Horace Smith (poet)|Horace Smith]] spent the Christmas season of 1817–1818 with Percy Bysshe Shelley and [[Mary Shelley]]. At this time, members of the Shelleys\' literary circle would sometimes challenge each other to write competing sonnets on a common subject: Shelley, [[John Keats]] and [[Leigh Hunt]] wrote competing sonnets about the Nile around the same time. Shelley and Smith both chose a passage from the writings of the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] in \'\'[[Bibliotheca historica]]\'\', which described a massive Egyptian statue and quoted its inscription: "King of Kings Ozymandias am I. If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work." In Shelley\'s poem, Diodorus becomes "a traveller from an antique land."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Siculus|first1=Diodorus|title=Bibliotheca Historica|location=1.47.4|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+1.47&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540}}</ref>{{efn|See footnote 10 at the following source, for reference to the Loeb Classical Library translation of this inscription, by C.H.
