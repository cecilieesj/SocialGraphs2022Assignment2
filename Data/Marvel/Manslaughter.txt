It is distinguished from voluntary manslaughter by the absence of intention. It is normally divided into two categories, constructive manslaughter and criminally negligent manslaughter, both of which involve criminal liability.\n\n====Constructive====\n\'\'\'Constructive manslaughter\'\'\' is also referred to as "unlawful act" manslaughter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Involuntary Manslaughter |url=https://ipsaloquitur.com/criminal-law/involuntary-manslaughter/ |website=IPSA LOQUITUR |access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref> It is based on the doctrine of constructive malice, whereby the malicious intent inherent in the commission of a crime is considered to apply to the consequences of that crime. It occurs when someone kills, without intent, in the course of committing an unlawful act. The malice involved in the crime is transferred to the killing, resulting in a charge of manslaughter.\n\nFor example, a person who fails to stop at a red traffic light while driving a vehicle and hits someone crossing the street could be found to intend or be reckless as to assault or criminal damage (see \'\'DPP v Newbury\'\'<ref>[1977] AC 500</ref>). There is no intent to kill, and a resulting death would not be considered murder, but would be considered involuntary manslaughter. The accused\'s responsibility for causing death is constructed from the fault in committing what might have been a minor criminal act. Reckless driving or reckless handling of a potentially lethal weapon may result in a death that is deemed manslaughter. The \'\'DPP v Newbury\'\' case had redefined the meaning of murder in the Australian constitution, and reformed in order to include a \'\'[[mens rea]]\'\' assessment.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter may be distinguished from accidental death. A person who is driving carefully, but whose car nevertheless hits a child darting out into the street, has not committed manslaughter. A person who pushes off an aggressive drunk, who then falls and dies, has probably not committed manslaughter, although in some jurisdictions it may depend whether "excessive force" was used or other factors.\n\nAs manslaughter is not defined by legislation in Australia, common law decisions provide the basis for determining whether an act resulting in death amounts to manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.<ref name="Lane v R">{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|317|2013|litigants=Lane v R |pinpoint=[46] |courtname=auto |date-}}.</ref> To be found guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, the accused must be shown to have committed an unlawful act which is contrary to the criminal law,<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1992|litigants=Wilson v R |parallelcite=(1992) 174 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 313 per Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ at [2] |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> and that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have known that by their act, they were exposing the victim to an "appreciable risk of serious injury".<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1992|litigants=Wilson v R |parallelcite=(1992) 174 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 313 per Mason CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ at [48] |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref>\n\n====Criminally negligent====\n{{Main|Negligent homicide}}\nCriminally negligent manslaughter is variously referred to as [[criminally negligent]] homicide in the [[United States]], and [[gross negligence]] manslaughter in [[England and Wales]]. In [[Scotland]] and some [[Commonwealth of Nations]] jurisdictions the offence of [[culpable homicide]] might apply.\n\nIt occurs where death results from serious [[criminal negligence|negligence]], or, in some jurisdictions, serious [[Recklessness (law)|recklessness]]. A high degree of negligence is required to warrant criminal liability.<ref name="R v Lavender"/> A related concept is that of [[willful blindness]], which is where a defendant intentionally puts themselves in a position where they will be unaware of facts which would render them liable.\n\nCriminally negligent manslaughter occurs where there is an omission to act when there is a duty to do so, or a failure to perform a duty owed, which leads to a death. The existence of the duty is essential because the law does not impose criminal liability for a failure to act unless a specific duty is owed to the victim. It is most common in the case of professionals who are grossly negligent in the course of their employment. An example is where a doctor fails to notice a patient\'s oxygen supply has disconnected and the patient dies (\'\'R v Adomako\'\' and \'\'R v Perreau\'\').<ref>{{cite BAILII|court=UKHL |year=1994 |num=6 |litigants=R v Adomako |parallelcite=[1994] 3 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 288 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> Another example could be leaving a child locked in a car on a hot day.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n====Vehicular and intoxicated====\nIn some jurisdictions, such as some U.S. States,<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web|title=New York Penal Code, Sec. 125.13.

The authority for the \'\'actus reus\'\' and \'\'mens rea\'\' of involuntary manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act is the High Court of Australia case of \'\'Wilson v R\'\'.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1992|litigants=Wilson v R |parallelcite=(1992) 174 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 313 |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> This case determined that the act that caused the death must breach the criminal law and that the act must carry an appreciable risk of serious injury (\'\'actus reus\'\').
