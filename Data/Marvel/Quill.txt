The best quills were usually made from goose, swan, and later turkey feathers. Quills went into decline after the invention of the metal [[pen]], mass production beginning in Great Britain as early as 1822 by John Mitchell of [[Birmingham]].<ref name="A Note on the Quill"/> In the Middle East and much of the Islamic world, quills were not used as writing implements. Only reed pens were used as writing implements.<ref>Francois Déroche, Islamic Codicology: An Introduction to the Study of Manuscripts in Arabic Script (London: Al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation, 2005), 103–6</ref>\n\nQuill pens were the instrument of choice during the [[medieval era]] due to their compatibility with [[parchment]] and [[vellum]]. Before this the [[reed pen]] had been used, but a finer letter was achieved on animal skin using a cured quill. Other than written text, they were often used to create figures, decorations, and images on [[manuscript]]s, although many illuminators and painters preferred fine brushes for their work. The variety of different strokes in formal hands was accomplished by good penmanship as the tip was square cut and rigid, exactly as it is today with modern steel pens.\n\nIt was much later, in the 1600s, with the increased popularity of writing, especially in the [[copperplate script]] promoted by the many printed manuals available from the \'Writing Masters\', that quills became more pointed and flexible.\n\nQuills are denominated from the order in which they are fixed in the wing; the first is favoured by the expert calligrapher, the second and third quills being very satisfactory also, plus the pinion feather. Flags the 5th and 6th feathers are also used. No other feather on the wing would be considered suitable by a professional [[scribe]]{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2020}}.\n\nInformation can be obtained on the techniques of curing and cutting quills:<ref>{{cite book|last=Child|first=Heather|title=The Calligraphers Handbook|publisher=A & C Black UK|year=1985|isbn=0-7136-2695-X}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In order to harden a quill that is soft, thrust the barrel into hot ashes, stirring it till it is soft; then taking it out, press it almost flat upon your knees with the back of a penknife, and afterwards reduce it to a roundness with your fingers. If you have a number to harden, set water and alum over the fire; and while it is boiling put in a handful of quills, the barrels only, for a minute, and then lay them by.<ref>\'\'Encyclopædia Britannica\'\', 6th edition, 1823.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn accurate account of the Victorian process by William Bishop, from researches with one of the last London quill dressers, is recorded in the \'\'Calligrapher\'s Handbook\'\' cited on this page.\n\n==As a symbol==\n[[File:Mynämäki.vaakuna.svg|thumb|right|upright|The coat of arms of [[Mynämäki]] in Finland]]\nFrom the 19th century in [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] symbolism, quills have been used to symbolize [[clerk]]s and [[intelligentsia]]. Some notable examples are the [[Radical Civic Union]], the [[Czech National Social Party]] in combination with the hammer, symbol of the [[labour movement]], or the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]].\n\nQuills appear on the seals of the [[United States Census Bureau]] and the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]]. They also appear in the coats of arms of several US Army [[Adjutant general]] units which focus on administrative duties.\n\nQuills are on the coats of arms of a number of municipalities such as [[Bargfeld-Stegen]] in Germany and [[La Canonja]] in Spain.\n\nThree books and a quill pen are the symbols of Saint [[Hilary of Poitiers]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cornwell |first=Hilarie |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317778053 |title=Saints, signs, and symbols |date=2009 |publisher=Morehouse Pub |isbn=978-0-8192-2345-6 |location=Harrisburg, PA |pages=45 |oclc=317778053}}</ref>\n\n==Quill and pen knives==\nA quill knife was the original primary tool used for cutting and sharpening quills, known as "dressing".\n\nFollowing the decline of the quill in the 1820s, after the introduction of the maintenance-free, mass-produced steel dip nib by John Mitchell, knives were still manufactured but became known as desk knives, stationery knives or latterly as the name stuck [[pen knife|"pen" knives]].\n\nThere is a small but significant difference between a pen knife and a quill knife, in that the quill knife has a blade that is flat on one side and convex on the other which facilitates the round cuts required to shape a quill.\n\nA "pen" knife by contrast has two flat sides. This distinction is not recognised by modern traders, dealers or collectors, who define a quill knife as any small knife with a fixed or hinged blade, including such items as ornamental fruit knives.\n\n==Today==\nWhile quills are rarely used as writing instruments in the modern day, they are still being produced as specialty items, mostly for hobbyists. Such quills tend to have metal nibs or are sometimes even outfitted with a ballpoint pen inside to remove the need for a separate source of ink.\n\nAccording to the [[Supreme Court Historical Society]], 20 goose-quill pens, neatly crossed, are placed at the four counsel tables each day the U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] is in session;<ref name=":1" /> "most lawyers appear before the Court only once, and gladly take the quills home as [[souvenir]]s."<ref>"[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/how-the-court-works/how-the-court-work/oral-argument/ How the court works]." Supreme Court Historical Society.</ref> This has been done since the earliest sessions of the Court.<ref>"[{{SCOTUS URL|about/traditions.pdf}} The Court and Its Traditions]." [[Supreme Court of the United States]].</ref>\n\nIn the [[Ktav Stam|Jewish tradition]] quill pens, called \'\'[[kulmus]]\'\' ({{lang|he|קולמוס}}), are used by [[Sofer|scribes]] to write Torah Scrolls, Mezuzot, and Tefillin.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The kulmus (quill) and how to cut it |url=https://www.sofer.co.uk/kulmus |access-date=2021-10-04 |website=www.sofer.co.uk |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[Plectrum|Plectra]] for [[psaltery|psalteries]] and [[lute]]s can be cut similarly to writing pens. The [[rachis]], the portion of the stem between the barbs, not the calamus, of the primary flight feathers of birds of the \'\'[[Corvidae]]\'\' was preferred for harpsichords. In modern instruments, plastic is more common, but they are often still called "quills".<ref name="Grove"/> The [[lesiba]] uses a quill attached to a string to produce sound.\n\n==See also==\n*The spiny barbs of a [[porcupine]]\n*In a zoological context, a [[Spine (zoology)|spine]] is a hard, needlelike anatomical structure.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Quills}}\n*[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa100197.htm A brief history of writing instruments]\n*[http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/tools/quill.htm Tutorial on Medieval method of creating quills] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512213911/http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/tools/quill.htm |date=2015-05-12 }}\n\n{{Pens}}\n\n[[Category:Feathers]]\n[[Category:Writing implements]]\n[[Category:Poultry products]]'}]}}
