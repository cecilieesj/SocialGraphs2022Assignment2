Drake expanded his interests to the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), beginning with [[Project Ozma]] in 1960, an attempt at [[extraterrestrial communications]]. He developed the [[Drake equation]], which attempts to quantify the number of intelligent lifeforms that could potentially be discovered. Working with [[Carl Sagan]], Drake helped to design the [[Pioneer plaque]], the first physical message flown beyond the Solar System, and was part of the team that developed the [[Voyager record]]. Drake designed and implemented the [[Arecibo message]] in 1974, an extraterrestrial radio transmission of astronomical and biological information about Earth.\n\nDrake worked at the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Cornell University]], [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] and the [[SETI Institute]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on May 28, 1930, in Chicago, Illinois,<ref name="natgeo">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/frank-drake-pioneer-in-the-search-for-alien-life-dies-at-92|title=Frank Drake, pioneer in the search for alien life, dies at 92|date=September 2, 2022|website=Science}}</ref> Drake showed an early interest in electronics and chemistry.<ref name="seti-obit">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seti.org/frank-d-drake-1930-2022|title=Frank D.

His ideas about the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]] were reinforced by a lecture from astrophysicist [[Otto Struve]] in 1951.<ref name="famous-scientists"/> After receiving a B.A. in Engineering Physics, Drake served briefly as an electronics officer on the [[heavy cruiser]] [[USS Albany (CA-123)|USS \'\'Albany\'\']]. He then went on to graduate school at [[Harvard University]] from 1952 to 1955 where he received a M.S. and Ph.D. in Astronomy. His [[doctoral advisor]] was [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]].<ref name=payne>{{cite web | title =Personal Portrait: CECILIA PAYNE | url = https://lydianz.com/personal-portrait-cecilia-payne/ | access-date = May 2, 2020}}{{dead link|date=September 2022}}</ref><ref name="natgeo"/>\n\n== Career ==\nDrake began his research career as a [[radio astronomer]], working at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ([[NRAO]]) in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]] from 1958–63. At NRAO, he conducted research into radio emissions from the [[planets of the Solar System]]: using the radio telescope at Green Bank, Drake discovered the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] of [[Jupiter]], and observed the [[atmosphere of Venus]]. He also mapped the radio emission from the [[Galactic Center]].<ref name="famous-scientists"/><ref name="nss"/> Drake extended the capabilities of the under-construction [[Arecibo Observatory]] to allow it to be used for radio astronomy (it was originally designed purely for [[ionosphere|ionospheric physics]]).<ref name="nss">{{Cite web|url=http://isdc2018.nss.org/team-member/dr-frank-drake/|title=Dr. Frank Drake|website=ISDC 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1959, Drake obtained approval from the director{{who|date=September 2022}} of NRAO to begin [[Project Ozma]], a search for extraterrestrial radio communications.<ref name="oxford-reference"/> Initially, they agreed to keep the project secret, fearing public ridicule. However, Drake decided to publicize his project after [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] and [[Philip Morrison]] published a paper in \'\'[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\'\' in September 1959, entitled "Searching for Interstellar Communications".<ref name="famous-scientists"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ccocconi|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Morrison|first2=Philip|title=Searching for Interstellar Communications|journal=Nature|volume=184|pages=844–846|year=1959|issue=4690 |doi=10.1038/184844a0|bibcode=1959Natur.184..844C |s2cid=4220318 }}</ref> Drake began his Project Ozma observations in 1960, using the NRAO 26-meter radio telescope, by searching for possible signals from the star systems [[Tau Ceti]] and [[Epsilon Eridani]]. No extraterrestrial signals were detected and the project was terminated in July 1960. After learning about Project Ozma, [[Carl Sagan]] (then a graduate student) contacted Drake, initiating a lifelong collaboration between them.<ref name="oxford-reference"/><ref name="famous-scientists"/>\n\nIn 1961, Drake devised the [[Drake equation]], which attempted estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that might be detectable in the [[Milky Way]].<ref name="famous-scientists"/> The Drake equation has been described as the "second most-famous equation in science", after [[E=mc2|E=mc<sup>2</sup>]].<ref name="seti-drake-equation">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seti.org/drake-equation-index|title=Drake Equation}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Drake served as section chief of Lunar and Planetary Science at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].
