Its [[semantic field]] corresponds to English [[ghost]], spirit, [[mind]], [[intellect]]. Some English translators resort to using "spirit/mind" or "spirit (mind)" to help convey the meaning of the term.<ref>C. Marvin Pate. \'\'From Plato to Jesus: What Does Philosophy Have to Do with Theology?\'\'. 2011, page 69.\nRosenkranz, Karl. \'\'Hegel, as the national philosopher of Germany\'\'. 1874, page 85</ref>\n\n\'\'Geist\'\' is also a central concept in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]\'s 1807 \'\'[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]\'\' (\'\'Phänomenologie des Geistes\'\'). Notable compounds, all associated with Hegel\'s view of [[world history]] of the late 18th century, include  \'\'\'\'\'Weltgeist\'\'\'\'\' "world-spirit", \'\'\'\'\'Volksgeist\'\'\'\'\' "national spirit"  and  \'\'\'\'\'Zeitgeist\'\'\'\'\'  "spirit of the age".\n\n==Etymology and translation==\n{{see|Spirit (animating force)|Pneuma|Psyche (psychology)|Soul}}\nGerman \'\'Geist\'\' (masculine gender: \'\'der Geist\'\') continues [[Old High German]] \'\'geist\'\', attested as the translation of Latin \'\'spiritus\'\'.\nIt is the direct cognate of English \'\'[[:wikt:ghost|ghost]]\'\', from a [[West Germanic]] \'\'gaistaz\'\'. Its derivation from a [[PIE root]] \'\'g̑heis-\'\' "to be agitated, frightened" suggests that the Germanic word originally referred to frightening  (c.f. English [[:wikt:ghastly|ghastly]]) apparitions or [[ghost]]s, and may also have carried the connotation of "ecstatic agitation, \'\'[[odhr|furor]]\'\'" related to the cult of [[Germanic Mercury]].\nAs the translation of biblical Latin \'\'spiritus\'\' (Greek πνεῦμα) "[[pneuma|spirit, breath]]" the Germanic word acquires a Christian meaning from an early time, notably in reference to the [[Holy Spirit]] (Old English \'\'sē hālga gāst\'\' "the Holy Ghost", OHG \'\' ther heilago geist\'\', Modern German \'\'der Heilige Geist\'\').\nThe English word is in competition with Latinate \'\'spirit\'\' from the Middle English period, but its broader meaning is preserved well into the early modern period.<ref>As observed by [[Alexander Gil]], \'\'The sacred philosophy of the holy scripture: laid down... in... the apostles\'\' (1635): "The word Ghost in English [...] is as much as athem, or breath; in our new Latin language, a Spirit." Spenser in 1590 could still say \'\'No knight so rude, I weene, As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost\'\' (\'\'[[Faerie Queene]]\'\' II. viii. 26), by "sleeping ghost" referring to the sleeping mind of a living person, not the ghost of a deceased one.</ref>\n\nThe German noun much like English \'\'spirit\'\' could refer to spooks or ghostly apparitions of the dead,  to the religious concept, as in the Holy Spirit, as well as to the "spirit of wine", i.e. [[ethanol]].\nHowever, its special meaning of "[[mind]], [[intellect]]" never shared by English \'\'ghost\'\' is acquired only in the 18th century, under the influence of French \'\'esprit\'\'.\nIn this sense it became extremely productive in the German language of the 18th century in general as well as in 18th-century German philosophy.\n\'\'Geist\'\' could now refer to the quality of intellectual brilliance, to wit, innovation, erudition, etc.\nIt is also in this time that the adjectival distinction of \'\'geistlich\'\' "spiritual, pertaining to religion" vs. \'\'geistig\'\' "intellectual, pertaining to the mind" begins to be made. Reference to spooks or ghosts  is made by the adjective \'\'geisterhaft\'\' "ghostly, spectral".<ref name=Pfeifer>[https://www.dwds.de/wb/Geist#et-1 Geist] in Wolfgang Pfeifer, \'\'Etymologisches Wörterbuch\'\' ([1989] 2010).</ref>\n\nNumerous [[German compounds|compounds]] are formed in the 18th to 19th centuries, some of them loan translations of French expressions, such as \'\'Geistesgegenwart\'\' = \'\'présence d\'esprit\'\' ("mental presence, acuity"), \'\'Geistesabwesenheit\'\' = \'\'absence d’esprit\'\' ("mental absence,  distraction"), \'\'geisteskrank\'\' "mentally ill", \'\'geistreich\'\' "witty, intellectually brilliant", \'\'geistlos\'\' "unintelligent, unimaginative, vacuous" etc.\nIt is from these developments that certain German compounds containing \'\'-geist\'\' have been loaned into English, such as \'\'[[Zeitgeist]]\'\'.<ref name="Zeitgeist">\'\'Zeitgeist\'\' "spirit of the epoch" and \'\'Nationalgeist\'\' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, \'\'Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte\'\' (1789).\n\'\'der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist\'\' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], \'\'Handbibliothek für Freunde\'\' 5 (1791), p. 57.\n\'\'Zeitgeist\'\' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].\n[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&mode=Vernetzung&hitlist=&patternlist=&lemid=GZ03558#XGZ03567 Zeitgeist] in Grimm, \'\'Deutsches Wörterbuch\'\'.</ref>\n\nGerman \'\'Geist\'\' in this particular sense of "mind, wit, erudition; intangible essence, spirit" has no precise English-language equivalent, for which reason translators sometimes retain \'\'Geist\'\' as a German loanword.\n\nThere is a second word for \'\'ghost\'\' in German: \'\'[[:de:Gespenst|das Gespenst]]\'\' (neutral gender). \'\'Der Geist\'\' is used slightly more often to refer to a ghost (in the sense of flying white creature) than \'\'das Gespenst\'\'. The corresponding adjectives are \'\'gespenstisch\'\' ("ghostly", "spooky") and \'\'gespensterhaft\'\' ("ghost-like"). A \'\'Gespenst\'\' is described in German as \'\'spukender Totengeist\'\', a "spooking ghost of the dead". The adjectives \'\'geistig\'\' and \'\'geistlich\'\' on the other hand, can not be used to describe something spooky, as \'\'geistig\'\' means "mental", and \'\'geistlich\'\' means either "spiritual" or refers to employees of the church. \'\'Geisterhaft\'\' would also mean, like \'\'gespensterhaft\'\', "ghost-like". While "spook" means \'\'der Spuk\'\' (male gender), the adjective of this word is only used in its English form, \'\'spooky\'\'. The more common German adjective would be \'\'gruselig\'\', deriving from \'\'der Grusel\'\' (\'\'das ist gruselig\'\', colloquially: \'\'das ist spooky\'\', meaning "that is spooky").\n\n== Hegelianism ==\n\'\'Geist\'\' is a central concept in [[Hegel]]\'s \'\'[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]\'\' (\'\'Phänomenologie des Geistes\'\').  According to some interpretations, the \'\'Weltgeist\'\' ("world spirit") is not an actual object or a transcendental, Godlike thing, but a means of philosophizing about history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  \'\'Weltgeist\'\' is effected in history through the [[mediation]] of various \'\'[[Volksgeist]]er\'\' ("national spirits"), the [[hero|great men]] of history, such as [[Napoleon]], are the "[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] [[universality (philosophy)|universal]]".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThis has led some to claim that Hegel favored the [[great man theory]], although his [[philosophy of history]], in particular concerning the role of the "[[universality (philosophy)|universal]] state" (\'\'Universalstaat\'\', which means a universal "order" or "statute" rather than "[[State (polity)|state]]"), and of an "End of History" is much more complex.\n\nFor Hegel, the great hero is unwittingly utilized by \'\'Geist\'\' or \'\'absolute spirit\'\', by a "ruse of reason" as he puts it, and is irrelevant to history once his historic mission is accomplished; he is thus subjected to the [[teleology|teleological]] principle of history, a principle which allows Hegel to reread the history of philosophy as culminating in his philosophy of history.\n\n\'\'Weltgeist\'\', the world spirit concept, designates an [[idealism|idealistic]] principle of world explanation, which can be found from the beginnings of philosophy up to more recent time. The concept of world spirit was already accepted by the idealistic schools of ancient Indian philosophy, whereby one explained [[objective reality]] as its product. (See [[metaphysical objectivism]]) In the early philosophy of Greek antiquity, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all paid homage, amongst other things, to the [[concept]] of world spirit. Hegel later based his philosophy of history on it.\n\n==\'\'Weltgeist\'\'==\n{{see|Anima Mundi}}\n\'\'\'\'\'Weltgeist\'\'\'\'\' ("world-spirit") is older than the 18th century, at first (16th century) in the sense of "secularism, impiety, irreligiosity" (\'\'spiritus mundi\'\'), in the 17th century also personalised in the sense of  "man of the world", "mundane or secular person".\nAlso from the 17th century, \'\'Weltgeist\'\' acquired a philosophical or spiritual sense of "world-spirit" or "world-soul" (\'\'anima mundi, spiritus universi\'\') in the sense of [[Panentheism]], a spiritual essence permeating all of nature, or the active principle animating the universe, including the physical sense, such as the attraction  between [[magnetic force|magnet and iron]] or between [[Gravity|Moon and tide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engyes.com/en/dic-content/Weltgeist|title=Definition/Meaning of Weltgeist|publisher=EngYes|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref>[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&mode=Vernetzung&lemid=GW16923#XGW16923 Weltgeist] in Grimm, \'\'Deutsches Wörterbuch\'\'.</ref>\n\nThis idea of \'\'Weltgeist\'\' in the sense of \'\'anima mundi\'\' became very influential in 18th-century German philosophy. In philosophical contexts, \'\'der Geist\'\' on its own could refer to this concept, as in [[Christian Thomasius]], \'\'Versuch vom Wesen des Geistes\'\' (1709).<ref>Rudolf Eisler\'\'Wörterbuch der philosophischen Begriffe\'\' (1904),  406ff., 1760f.</ref>\nBelief in a \'\'Weltgeist\'\' as animating principle immanent to the universe became dominant in German thought due to the influence of [[Goethe]], in the later part of the 18th century.<ref>Korff, \'\'Geist der Göthezeit\'\' (1923).</ref>\n\nAlready in the  poetical language of Johann Ulrich von König (d. 1745), the \'\'Weltgeist\'\'\nappears as the active, masculine principle opposite the feminine principle of [[Nature]].\n<ref>J. U. von König, \'\'Gedichte\'\' (1745) p. 253</ref>\n\'\'Weltgeist\'\' in the sense of Goethe comes close to being a synonym of [[God]] and can be attributed agency and will.\n[[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], who tended to prefer the form \'\'Weltengeist\'\' (as it were "spirit of worlds"), pushes this to the point of composing prayers addressed to this world-spirit:\n:\'\' O Weltengeist, Bist du so gütig, wie du mächtig bist, Enthülle mir, den du mitfühlend zwar, Und doch so grausam schufst, erkläre mir Das Loos der Fühlenden, die durch mich leiden.\'\'\n:"O World-spirit, be as benevolent as you are powerful and reveal to me, whom you have created with compassion and yet cruelly, explain to me the lot of the sentient, who suffer through me"<ref>Herder, "Die Gärten der Hesperiden", \'\'Ausgewählte Werke\'\' 1, ed.

It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.<ref>{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt konzentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}\nHegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F.
