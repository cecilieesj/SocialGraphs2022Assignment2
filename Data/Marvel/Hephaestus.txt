Hera is not mentioned as the mother.\n* According to [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]] (Bibliotheca, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.3.6&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 1.3.6]), Hera gave birth to Hephaestus alone. Pseudo-Apollodorus also relates that, according to Homer, Hephaestus is one of the children of Zeus and Hera (consciously contradicting Hesiod and Homer).\n* Several later texts follow Hesiod\'s account, including [[Hyginus]] and the preface to \'\'[[Fabulae]]\'\'.\n\nIn the account of Attic vase painters, Hephaestus was present at the birth of Athena and wields the axe with which he split Zeus\' head to free her. In the latter account, Hephaestus is there represented as older than Athena, so the mythology of Hephaestus is inconsistent in this respect.\n\n===Fall from Olympus===\nIn one branch of Greek mythology, Hera ejected Hephaestus from the heavens because of his congenital impairment. He fell into the ocean and was raised by [[Thetis]] (mother of Achilles and one of the 50 [[Nereid]]s) and the [[Oceanid]] [[Eurynome (Oceanid)|Eurynome]].<ref name=Foot>\'\'Homeric Hymn to Apollo\'\' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D3%3Acard%3D305 316–321]; Homer, \'\'Iliad\'\' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D18%3Acard%3D388 395–405].</ref>\n\nIn another account, Hephaestus, attempting to rescue his mother from Zeus\' advances, was flung down from the heavens by Zeus.

When Pausanias saw it, he said:\n{{Quotation|There are paintings here &ndash; Dionysus bringing Hephaestus up to heaven.

Eventually, Hephaestus discovered Aphrodite\'s affair through [[Helios]], the all-seeing Sun, and planned a trap during one of their trysts. While Aphrodite and Ares lay together in bed, Hephaestus ensnared them in an unbreakable chain-link net so small as to be invisible and dragged them to Mount Olympus to shame them in front of the other gods for retribution.\n\nThe gods laughed at the sight of these naked lovers, and [[Poseidon]] persuaded Hephaestus to free them in return for a guarantee that Ares would pay the adulterer\'s fine or that he would pay it himself. Hephaestus states in \'\'The Odyssey\'\' that he would return Aphrodite to her father and demand back his bride price. The [[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]] translation depicts Hephaestus demanding/imploring Zeus before Poseidon offers, however, leading the reader to assume Zeus did not give back the "price" Hephaestus paid for "his daughter" and was thus why Poseidon intervened.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Emily |title=The Odyssey |date=7 November 2017 |publisher=W.
