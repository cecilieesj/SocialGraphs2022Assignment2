The red cars are those causing the gridlock by stopping in the middle of the intersection.]]\n\'\'\'Gridlock\'\'\' is a form of [[traffic congestion]] where "continuous queues of vehicles block an entire network of intersecting streets, bringing traffic in all directions to a complete standstill".<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/249126|url-access=subscription|title=Gridlock|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2011-05-03|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref>  The term originates from a situation possible in a [[grid plan]] where intersections are blocked, preventing vehicles from either moving forwards through the intersection or backing up to an upstream intersection.\n\nThe term \'\'Gridlock\'\' is also used incorrectly to describe high [[traffic congestion]] with minimal flow (which is simply a traffic jam), where a blocked grid system is not involved. By extension, the term has been applied to situations in other fields where flow is stalled by excess demand, or in which competing interests prevent progress.\n\n==Cause==\n[[File:Gridlock (Wiesbaden, Germany).jpg|thumb|Gridlock on Kaiser-Friedrich-Ring, Wiesbaden, Germany. Vehicles on three lanes blocking each others way.]]\n[[File:7th Street gridlock afternoon.jpg|thumb|Traffic gridlock in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. Lights are green but backups fill all the space.]]\nTraditional gridlock is caused by cars entering an intersection on a green light without enough room on the other side of the intersection \'\'at the time of entering\'\' to go all the way through.  This can lead to the car being trapped in the intersection when the light turns green in the other direction.  If the same situation occurs simultaneously in multiple intersections, these cars can be trapped in the intersections indefinitely.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, drivers are therefore prohibited from entering an intersection at a green light if there is no room for them to clear the intersection. If all drivers follow this rule, gridlock is impossible.<ref>Stringer, Scott M. \'\'[http://www.mbpo.org/uploads/policy_reports/mbp/DONT%20BLOCK%20THE%20BOX.pdf Thinking outside the box: an analysis of Manhattan gridlock and spillback enforcement]\'\', Office of Manhattan Borough President, July 2006. {{Dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of gridlock can occur during traffic surges between highway on-ramps and off-ramps located within a quarter mile of each other. Traffic exiting the highway may back up and block the entering vehicles.  Those entering vehicles in turn back up and block the exiting vehicles.\n\nGridlock is sometimes cited as an example of the [[prisoner\'s dilemma]] (from [[game theory]]).<ref>Heath, Joseph (1999). \'\'[http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3phl296/text/table.html Normative economics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118023857/http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3phl296/text/table.html |date=2007-11-18 }}\'\', Chapter 2, Section 3.

Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], noting that the ten-minute ticketing process actually contributes to overall [[traffic congestion]], has asked the [[New York State Legislature]] to remove “blocking the box” from the moving violation category.
