He becomes exasperated when anyone brings up the subject of his grandfather [[Victor Frankenstein]], the infamous [[mad scientist]] with whom he does not want to be associated, and insists that his surname is pronounced "Fronkensteen".{{sfnp|Picart|2003|p=46}} When a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family\'s estate in [[Transylvania]] after the death of his great-grandfather, the Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein, Frederick travels to Europe to inspect the property. At the Transylvania train station, he is met by a [[hunchback]]ed, bug-eyed servant named [[Igor (character)|Igor]], whose own grandfather worked for Victor; and a beautiful, young, female assistant named Inga.  Hearing that the professor pronounces his name "Fronkensteen", Igor insists that his name is pronounced "Eyegor", rather than the traditional "Eegor".\n\nArriving at the estate, Frederick meets Frau Blücher, the intimidating housekeeper. After discovering the secret entrance to Victor\'s laboratory and reading his private journals, Frederick decides to resume his grandfather\'s experiments in re-animating the dead. He and Igor steal the corpse of a recently executed criminal, and Frederick sets to work experimenting on the large corpse. He sends Igor to steal the brain of a deceased "scientist and saint", [[Hans Delbrück]]. Startled by his own reflection, Igor drops and ruins Delbrück\'s brain. Taking a second brain labeled "Abnormal", Igor returns with it, and Frederick transplants it into the corpse, thinking he has transplanted Delbrück\'s brain.\n\nFrederick brings the creature to life by electrical charges during a lightning storm. The creature takes its first steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, he attacks Frederick and nearly strangles him before he is sedated. Meanwhile, unaware of the creature\'s existence, the townspeople gather to discuss their unease at Frederick continuing his grandfather\'s work.

Returning to the lab, Frederick discovers Blücher setting the creature free. She reveals the monster\'s love of violin music and her own romantic relationship with Frederick\'s grandfather. The creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch and escapes the castle.\n\nWhile roaming the countryside, the monster has encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit, references to 1931\'s \'\'Frankenstein\'\' and 1935\'s \'\'[[Bride of Frankenstein]]\'\', respectively.{{sfnp|Picart|2003|p=54}} Frederick recaptures the monster and locks himself in a room with him. He calms the monster\'s homicidal tendencies with flattery and a promise to guide him to success, embracing his heritage as a Frankenstein. At a theater full of illustrious guests, Frederick shows "The Creature" following simple commands. The demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster, both in top hats and tuxedos, performing the musical number "[[Puttin\' On the Ritz]]". A stage light suddenly explodes and frightens the monster, interrupting the performance. The audience boo and throw vegetables at the monster, who becomes enraged and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police. Back in the laboratory, Inga attempts to comfort Frederick, and they fornicate on the suspended reanimation table.\n\nThe monster escapes from prison the same night that Frederick\'s fiancée Elizabeth arrives unexpectedly for a visit. The monster takes her captive as he flees. Elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his "[[Large penis|enormous schwanzstucker]]".{{sfnp|Hallenbeck|2009|p=108}} While the townspeople hunt for the monster, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle and recaptures him. Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature, who reasons with and placates the mob. Elizabeth, with her hair styled after that of the female creature from \'\'Bride of Frankenstein\'\'&mdash;marries the now erudite and sophisticated monster; while Inga, in bed with Frederick, asks what her new husband got in return during the transfer procedure. Frederick growls wordlessly and embraces Inga who, as Elizabeth did when abducted by the monster, sings the refrain "[[Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life]]".{{sfnp|Picart|2003|p=61}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as [[Frankenstein\'s monster|The Monster]]\n* [[Marty Feldman]] as [[Igor (character)|Igor]]\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Frau Blücher <!--neigh!-->\n* [[Teri Garr]] as Inga\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] as Inspector Kemp\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Richard Haydn]] as Herr Gerhardt Falkstein (lawyer)\n* Richard Roth as Insp.

He recalled,\n\n<blockquote>Little by little, every night, Gene and I met at his bungalow at the [[Bel Air Hotel]]. We ordered a pot of Earl Grey tea coupled with a container of cream and a small kettle of brown sugar cubes. To go with it we had a pack of British [[digestive biscuit]]s. And step-by-step, ever so cautiously, we proceeded on a dark narrow twisting path to the eventual screenplay in which good sense and caution are thrown out the window and madness ensues.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/mel-brooks-on-screenwriting/| title=Mel Brooks on Screenwriting| last=Swinson| first=Brock| date=January 14, 2016| publisher=Creative Screenwriting| access-date=January 21, 2016| archive-date=January 21, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121235340/http://creativescreenwriting.com/mel-brooks-on-screenwriting/| url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBrooks and Wilder argued over the sequence where Frankenstein and his creation perform "Puttin\' on the Ritz". Brooks felt it would be too silly to have the monster sing and dance, but eventually yielded to Wilder\'s arguments in defense of the sequence.<ref name=Hallenbeck/><ref name=SundayConBro/>\n\nUnlike in many of his other films, Brooks does not appear onscreen in a significant role in \'\'Young Frankenstein\'\', though he recorded several voice parts and portrays a German villager in one short scene. In 2012, Brooks explained why:\n\n<blockquote> I wasn\'t allowed to be in it. That was the deal Gene Wilder had. He [said], "If you\'re not in it, I\'ll do it." [Laughs.] He [said], "You have a way of breaking the [[fourth wall]], whether you want to or not. I just want to keep it. I don\'t want too much to be, you know, a wink at the audience.

He summed up that "\'\'Young Frankenstein\'\' is a movie for film buffs, but written, directed and performed in such a way that average Joes and Josephines can enjoy it just as much for its outrageous and wacky humor."<ref name=Hallenbeck/>\n\n=="Walk this way"==\nIgor\'s line "walk this way" in the film inspired the song "[[Walk This Way]]" by [[Aerosmith]].<ref>Sarah Rodman.
