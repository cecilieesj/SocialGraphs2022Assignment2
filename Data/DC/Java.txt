Majapahit was established by [[Raden Wijaya|Wijaya]],<ref name="Coedes" />{{rp|201}} and by the end of the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]] (r. 1350–89) it claimed sovereignty over the entire Indonesian archipelago, although control was likely limited to Java, Bali, and Madura. Hayam Wuruk\'s prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]], led many of the kingdom\'s territorial conquests.<ref name="Coedes" />{{rp|234}} Previous Javanese kingdoms had their power based on agriculture, however, Majapahit took control of ports and shipping lanes and became Java\'s first commercial empire. With the death of Hayam Wuruk and the [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|coming of Islam to Indonesia]], Majapahit went into decline.<ref name="Coedes" />{{rp|241}}\n\n===Spread of Islam and rise of Islamic sultanates===\n\n{{See also|Spread of Islam in Indonesia#Central and eastern Java}}\n\nIslam became the dominant religion in Java at the end of the 16th century. During this era, the Islamic kingdoms of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], and [[Banten Sultanate|Banten]] were ascendant. The [[Mataram Sultanate]] became the dominant power of central and eastern Java at the end of the 16th century. The principalities of Surabaya and Cirebon were eventually subjugated such that only Mataram and Banten were left to face the Dutch in the 17th century.\n\n===Colonial periods===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Thee-kweekbedden zonder afdak Java TMnr 10011931.jpg|thumb|Tea plantation in Java during [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial period]], in or before 1926]]\n\nJava\'s contact with the European colonial powers began in 1522 with [[Luso-Sundanese padrão|a treaty]] between the Sunda kingdom and the [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese in Malacca]].

Internal conflict prevented the Javanese from forming effective alliances against the Dutch. Remnants of the Mataram survived as the Surakarta (Solo) and Yogyakarta principalities. Javanese kings claimed to rule with divine authority and the Dutch helped them to preserve remnants of a Javanese aristocracy by confirming them as regents or district officials within the colonial administration.\n\nJava\'s major role during the early part of the colonial period was as a producer of rice. In spice-producing islands like [[Banda Islands|Banda]], rice was regularly imported from Java, to supply the deficiency in means of subsistence.<ref>{{cite book|last=St. John|first=Horace Stebbing Roscoe|title=The Indian Archipelago: its history and present state, Volume 1|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=1853 |page=[https://archive.org/details/indianarchipela02johngoog/page/n183 137]|url=https://archive.org/details/indianarchipela02johngoog}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Napoleonic wars]] in Europe, the [[Netherlands]] fell to [[France]], as did its colony in the [[East Indies]].

The elite class in Java has evolved over the course of history, as cultural wave after cultural wave immigrated to the island. There is evidence that South Asian emigres were among this elite, as well as Arabian and Persian immigrants during the Islamic eras.  More recently, Chinese immigrants have also become part of the economic elite of Java. Although politically the Chinese generally remain sidelined, there are notable exceptions, such as the former governor of Jakarta, [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]]. Though Java is increasingly becoming more modern and urban, only 75% of the island has electricity. Villages and their rice paddies are still a common sight. Unlike the rest of Java, the population growth in Central Java remains low. Central Java however has a younger population than the national average.<ref>[http://www.bkkbn.go.id/kependudukan/Pages/DataSensus/Sensus_Penduduk/Pola_Perkawinan/Rata_Usia_Kawin_Pertama/Nasional.aspx Usia Kawin Pertama Rata-Rata Wanita  Menurut Provinsi: Sensus Penduduk Tahun 1990, 2000 dan 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629055719/http://www.bkkbn.go.id/kependudukan/Pages/DataSensus/Sensus_Penduduk/Pola_Perkawinan/Rata_Usia_Kawin_Pertama/Nasional.aspx |date=2015-06-29 }}.

This is somewhat due to the fact that Java is the business, academic, and cultural hub of Indonesia, which attracts millions of non-Javanese people to its cities.

Classic arts of Java include [[gamelan]] music and [[wayang]] puppet shows.\n\nJava was the site of many influential kingdoms in the Southeast Asian region,<ref>See Wallace Stevens\'s poem "[[Tea (poem)|Tea]]" for an appreciative allusion to Javanese culture.</ref> and as a result, many literary works have been written by Javanese authors. These include \'\'[[Ken Arok]] and [[Ken Dedes]]\'\', the story of the orphan who usurped his king, and married the queen of the ancient Javanese kingdom; and translations of \'\'[[Ramayana]]\'\' and \'\'[[Mahabharata]]\'\'. [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]] is a famous contemporary Indonesian author, who has written many stories based on his own experiences of having grown up in Java, and takes many elements from Javanese folklore and historical legends.\n\n===Languages===\n[[File:Java languages.JPG|thumb|Languages spoken in Java (Javanese is shown in white).

A \'\'resi\'\' lived surrounded by students, who took care of their master\'s daily needs. Resi\'s authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, [[Brahmin]] clerics and \'\'pudjangga\'\' (sacred literati) legitimised rulers and linked [[Hinduism|Hindu]] cosmology to their political needs.<ref name="kroef1961"/> Small [[Hindu]] enclaves are scattered throughout Java, but there is a large [[Hindu]] population along the eastern coast nearest [[Bali]], especially around the town of [[Banyuwangi]].\n\nThe coming of [[Islam]], strengthened the status structure of this traditional religious pattern. More than 90 percent of the people of Java are Muslims, on a broad continuum between \'\'[[abangan]]\'\' (more traditional) and \'\'[[santri]]\'\' (more modernist). Muslim scholars (\'\'[[Kyai]]\'\') became the new religious elite as Hindu influences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal [[Clergy|priesthood]], but the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch colonial government]] established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese \'\'[[pesantren]]\'\' (Islamic schools), The \'\'Kyai\'\' perpetuated the tradition of the \'\'resi\'\'. Students around him provided his needs, even [[peasant]]s around the school.<ref name="kroef1961"/>\n\n<gallery class="center" mode="packed">\nFile:Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkartta, Candi Siliwangi Shrine.jpg|A [[Hindu]] shrine dedicated to [[King Siliwangi]] in [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]], [[Bogor]]\nFile:Candi Mendut 1.jpg|Mendut Vihara, a Buddhist monastery near [[Mendut]] temple, [[Magelang]]\nFile:Masjid Agung Yogyakarta.jpg|[[Kauman Great Mosque|Masjid Gedhe Kauman]] in [[Yogyakarta]], built in traditional Javanese multi-tiered roof\nFile:Ganjuran Church, exterior 01.jpg|[[Ganjuran Church]] in [[Bantul]], built in traditional [[Javanese culture|Javanese architecture]]\n</gallery>\n\nPre-Islamic Javan traditions have encouraged Islam in a mystical direction. There emerged in Java a loosely structured society of religious leadership, revolving around \'\'kyais\'\', possessing various degrees of proficiency in pre-Islamic and Islamic [[Folklore|lore]], [[belief]] and practice.<ref name="kroef1961"/> The kyais are the principal intermediaries between the villages masses and the realm of the [[supernatural]]. However, this very looseneess of kyai leadership structure has promoted [[schism (religion)|schism]]. There were often sharp divisions between orthodox kyais, who merely instructed in Islamic law, with those who taught [[mysticism]] and those who sought reformed Islam with modern scientific concepts. As a result, there is a division between \'\'santri\'\', who believe that they are more orthodox in their Islamic belief and practice, with \'\'[[abangan]]\'\', who have mixed pre-Islamic [[animism|animistic]] and Hindu-Indian concepts with a superficial acceptance of Islamic belief.<ref name="kroef1961"/>\n\nThere are also [[Christians|Christian]] communities, mostly in the larger cities, though some rural areas of south-central Java are strongly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] communities also exist in the major cities, primarily among the [[Chinese Indonesian]]. The Indonesian constitution recognises six official religions.\n\nA wider effect of this division is the number of sects. In the middle of 1956, the Department of Religious Affairs in [[Yogyakarta]] reported 63 religious sects in Java other than the official Indonesian religions. Of these, 35 were in [[Central Java]], 22 in [[West Java]] and six in [[East Java]].<ref name="kroef1961"/> These include [[Javanese beliefs|Kejawen]], [[Javanese beliefs|Sumarah]], [[Subud]], etc. Their total membership is difficult to estimate as many of their adherents identify themselves with one of the official religions.<ref name="Beatty">Beatty, Andrew, \'\'Varieties of Javanese Religion: An Anthropological Account\'\', Cambridge University Press 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-62473-8}}</ref> [[Sunda Wiwitan]] is a traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] religion, its adherents still exist in several villages.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dcTAQAAMAAJ&q=sunda+wiwitan+religion|title=Tempo: Indonesia\'s Weekly News Magazine|date=2006|publisher=Arsa Raya Perdana|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Water buffalo]] ploughing [[Paddy field|rice fields]] near [[Salatiga]], in [[Central Java]]]]\nInitially the economy of Java relied heavily on [[rice]] agriculture. Ancient kingdoms such as the [[Tarumanagara]], [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]], and [[Majapahit]] were dependent on rice yields and tax. Java was famous for rice surpluses and rice export since ancient times, and rice agriculture contributed to the population growth of the island. Trade with other parts of Asia such as ancient India and China flourished as early as the 4th century, as evidenced by Chinese ceramics found on the island dated to that period. Java also took part in the global trade of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] [[spice]] from ancient times in the Majapahit era, until well into the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) era.\n\n[[File:Java Transportation Network.svg|thumb|Java transport network]]\nThe VOC set their foothold on [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in the 17th century and was succeeded by the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the 19th century. During these colonial times, the Dutch introduced the cultivation of commercial plants in Java, such as [[sugarcane]], [[rubber]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[quinine]]. In the 19th and early 20th century, Javanese coffee gained global popularity. Thus, the name "Java" today has become a synonym for coffee.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/why-is-coffee-called-a-cup-of-joe#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20the,to%20be%20known%20as%20java | title=Why is Coffee Called "A Cup of Joe"? &#124; Wonderopolis }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.littlecoffeeplace.com/why-is-coffee-called-java|title=Why is Coffee Called Java?

The road transportation networks that have existed since ancient times were connected and perfected with the construction of [[Great Post Road|Java Great Post Road]] by [[Daendels]] in the early 19th century. It became the backbone of Java\'s road infrastructure and laid the base of [[North Coast Road (Java)|Java North Coast Road]] ({{lang-id|Jalan Pantura, abbreviation from "Pantai Utara"}}). The need to transport commercial produces such as coffee from plantations in the interior of the island to the harbour on the coast spurred the construction of railway networks in Java. Today, industry, business, trade and services flourished in major cities of Java, such as [[Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Semarang]], and [[Bandung]]; while some traditional Sultanate cities such as [[Yogyakarta]], [[Surakarta]], and [[Cirebon]] preserved its royal legacy and has become the centre of art, culture and tourism. Industrial estates are also growing in towns on northern coast of Java, especially around [[Cilegon]], [[Tangerang]], [[Bekasi]], [[Karawang]], [[Gresik]] and [[Sidoarjo]]. The [[toll road]] highway networks was built and expanded since the New Order until the present day, connecting major urban centres and surrounding areas, such as in and around [[Jakarta]] and [[Bandung]]; also the ones in [[Cirebon]], [[Semarang]] and [[Surabaya]]. In addition to these motorways, Java has 16 national highways.\n\nBased on the statistical data by the year of 2021 released by [[Statistics Indonesia]] (\'\'Badan Pusat Statistik\'\'), Java alone contributes around 60% of Indonesia\'s GDP or equivalent to US$686&nbsp;billion(int$2.0 trillion, PPP).<ref name="bps">{{Cite book|title=PDRB Atas Dasar Harga Berlaku Menurut Pengeluaran (Juta Rupiah), 2021|author=Badan Pusat Statistik|author-link=Statistics Indonesia|publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik|year=2022|location=Jakarta|url=https://www.bps.go.id/indicator/171/534/1/-seri-2010-1-pdrb-atas-dasar-harga-berlaku-menurut-pengeluaran.html}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Islands}}\n*[[History of Indonesia]]\n*[[List of monarchs of Java]]\n*[[Javanese people]]\n*[[Sundanese people]]\n*[[Betawi people]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Jean Gelman|title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories|url=https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean|url-access=registration|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2003|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-10518-6}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikivoyage|Java}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cribb|first=Robert |year=2000 |title=Historical Atlas of Indonesia |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalatlaso0000crib |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon Press, University of Hawaii Press|location=London and Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-2111-1|url-access=registration}}\n*Padmo, Soegijanto (2000). \'\'[https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/11597-java-and-the-making-op-the-nation-2d30d285.pdf Java and The Making of The Nation.]\'\' Humaniora Journal, Gadjah Mada University.\n\n{{Provinces of Indonesia}}\n{{World\'s largest islands}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Java| ]]\n[[Category:Greater Sunda Islands]]\n[[Category:Islands of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Maritime Southeast Asia]]'}]}}
