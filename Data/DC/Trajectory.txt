In [[classical mechanics]], a trajectory is defined by [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] via [[canonical coordinates]]; hence, a complete trajectory is defined by position and [[momentum]], simultaneously.\n\nThe mass might be a [[projectile]] or a [[satellite]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Principles of Physics |first=Rohit |last=Metha |chapter=11 |page=378}}</ref> For example, it can be an [[orbit]] — the path of a [[planet]], [[asteroid]], or [[comet]] as it travels around a [[primary (astronomy)|central mass]].\n\nIn [[control theory]], a trajectory is a time-ordered set of [[state (controls)|state]]s of a [[dynamical system]] (see e.g. [[Poincaré map]]). In [[discrete mathematics]], a trajectory is a sequence <math>(f^k(x))_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> of values calculated by the iterated application of a mapping <math>f</math> to an element <math>x</math> of its source.\n\n== Physics of trajectories ==\n{{confusing|date=November 2011}}\n\nA familiar example of a trajectory is the path of a projectile, such as a thrown ball or rock. In a significantly simplified model, the object moves only under the influence of a uniform gravitational [[Force field (physics)|force field]]. This can be a good approximation for a rock that is thrown for short distances, for example at the surface of the [[moon]]. In this simple approximation, the trajectory takes the shape of a [[parabola]]. Generally when determining trajectories, it may be necessary to account for nonuniform gravitational forces and air resistance ([[drag (physics)|drag]] and [[aerodynamics]]). This is the focus of the discipline of [[ballistics]].\n\nOne of the remarkable achievements of [[Newtonian mechanics]] was the derivation of [[Kepler\'s laws of planetary motion]]. In the gravitational field of a point mass or a spherically-symmetrical extended mass (such as the [[Sun]]), the trajectory of a moving object is a [[conic section]], usually an [[ellipse]] or a [[hyperbola]].{{efn|It is theoretically possible for an orbit to be a radial straight line, a circle, or a parabola. These are limiting cases which have zero probability of occurring in reality.}} This agrees with the observed orbits of [[planets]], [[comets]], and artificial spacecraft to a reasonably good approximation, although if a comet passes close to the Sun, then it is also influenced by other [[force]]s such as the [[solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]], which modify the orbit and cause the comet to eject material into space.\n\nNewton\'s theory later developed into the branch of [[theoretical physics]] known as [[classical mechanics]]. It employs the mathematics of [[differential calculus]] (which was also initiated by Newton in his youth). Over the centuries, countless scientists have contributed to the development of these two disciplines. Classical mechanics became a most prominent demonstration of the power of rational thought, i.e. [[reason]], in science as well as technology. It helps to understand and predict an enormous range of [[phenomena]]; trajectories are but one example.\n\nConsider a particle of [[mass]] <math>m</math>, moving in a [[Gravitational potential|potential field]] <math>V</math>. Physically speaking, mass represents [[inertia]], and the field <math>V</math> represents external forces of a particular kind known as "conservative". Given <math>V</math> at every relevant position, there is a way to infer the associated force that would act at that position, say from gravity. Not all forces can be expressed in this way, however.\n\nThe motion of the particle is described by the second-order [[differential equation]]\n\n:<math> m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\vec{x}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -\\nabla V(\\vec{x}(t)) \\text{ with } \\vec{x}=(x,y,z).</math>\n\nOn the right-hand side, the force is given in terms of <math>\\nabla V</math>, the [[gradient]] of the potential, taken at positions along the trajectory. This is the mathematical form of Newton\'s [[Newton\'s second law|second law of motion]]: force equals mass times acceleration, for such situations.\n\n==Examples==\n\n=== Uniform gravity, neither drag nor wind===\n[[File:Inclinedthrow.gif|thumb|400px|Trajectories of a mass thrown at an angle of 70°,<br>\n{{color box|black}} without [[Drag (physics)|drag]]<br>\n{{color box|blue}} with [[Stokes\' law|Stokes drag]]<br>\n{{color box|green}} with [[Newtonian fluid|Newton drag]]]]\n\nThe ideal case of motion of a projectile in a uniform gravitational field in the absence of other forces (such as air drag) was first investigated by [[Galileo Galilei]]. To neglect the action of the atmosphere in shaping a trajectory would have been considered a futile hypothesis by practical-minded investigators all through the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]]. Nevertheless, by anticipating the existence of the [[vacuum]], later to be demonstrated on [[Earth]] by his collaborator [[Evangelista Torricelli]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, Galileo was able to initiate the future science of [[mechanics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In a near vacuum, as it turns out for instance on the [[Moon]], his simplified parabolic trajectory proves essentially correct.\n\nIn the analysis that follows, we derive the equation of motion of a projectile as measured from an [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]] at rest with respect to the ground. Associated with the frame is a right-hand coordinate system with its origin at the point of launch of the projectile. The <math>x</math>-axis is tangent to the ground, and the <math>y</math>axis is perpendicular to it ( parallel to the gravitational field lines ). Let <math>g</math> be the [[standard gravity|acceleration of gravity]]. Relative to the flat terrain, let the initial horizontal speed be <math>v_h = v \\cos(\\theta)</math> and the initial vertical speed be <math>v_v = v \\sin(\\theta)</math>. It will also be shown that the [[range of a projectile|range]] is <math>2v_h v_v/g</math>, and the maximum altitude is <math>v_v^2/2g</math>. The maximum range for a given initial speed <math>v</math> is obtained when <math>v_h=v_v</math>, i.e. the initial angle is 45<math>^\\circ</math>. This range is <math>v^2/g</math>, and the maximum altitude at the maximum range is <math>v^2/(4g)</math>.\n\n====Derivation of the equation of motion====\nAssume the motion of the projectile is being measured from a [[free fall]] frame which happens to be at (\'\'x\'\',\'\'y\'\')&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0,0) at&nbsp;\'\'t\'\'&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. The equation of motion of the projectile in this frame (by the [[equivalence principle]]) would be <math>y = x \\tan(\\theta)</math>. The co-ordinates of this free-fall frame, with respect to our inertial frame would be <math>y = - gt^2/2</math>. That is, <math>y = - g(x/v_h)^2/2</math>.\n\nNow translating back to the inertial frame the co-ordinates of the projectile becomes <math>y = x \\tan(\\theta)- g(x/v_h)^2/2</math> That is:\n\n: <math>y=-{g\\sec^2\\theta\\over 2v_0^2}x^2+x\\tan\\theta,</math>\n\n(where \'\'v\'\'<sub>0</sub> is the initial velocity, <math>\\theta</math> is the angle of elevation, and \'\'g\'\' is the acceleration due to gravity).\n\n====Range and height====\n[[Image:Ideal projectile motion for different angles.svg|thumb|350px|Trajectories of projectiles launched at different elevation angles but the same speed of 10 m/s in a vacuum and uniform downward gravity field of 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Points are at 0.05 s intervals and length of their tails is linearly proportional to their speed. \'\'t\'\' = time from launch, \'\'T\'\' = time of flight, \'\'R\'\' = range and \'\'H\'\' = highest point of trajectory (indicated with arrows).]]\nThe \'\'\'range\'\'\', \'\'R\'\', is the greatest distance the object travels along the [[x-axis]] in the I sector. The \'\'\'initial velocity\'\'\', \'\'v<sub>i</sub>\'\', is the speed at which said object is launched from the point of origin. The \'\'\'initial angle\'\'\', \'\'θ<sub>i</sub>\'\', is the angle at which said object is released. The \'\'g\'\' is the respective gravitational pull on the object within a null-medium.\n\n: <math>R={v_i^2\\sin2\\theta_i\\over g}</math>\n\nThe \'\'\'height\'\'\', \'\'h\'\', is the greatest parabolic height said object reaches within its trajectory\n: <math>h={v_i^2\\sin^2\\theta_i\\over 2g}</math>\n\n====Angle of elevation====\n[[File:Selomie Melkie - Forensics Final Project (5).jpg|thumb|An example showing how to calculate bullet trajectory]]\nIn terms of angle of elevation <math>\\theta</math> and initial speed <math>v</math>:\n\n:<math>v_h=v \\cos \\theta,\\quad v_v=v \\sin \\theta \\;</math>\n\ngiving the range as\n\n:<math>R= 2 v^2 \\cos(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) / g = v^2 \\sin(2\\theta) / g\\,.</math>\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to find the angle for a required range\n\n: <math> \\theta =  \\frac 1 2 \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{g R}{ v^2 } \\right) </math> (Equation II: angle of projectile launch)\n\nNote that the [[sine]] function is such that there are two solutions for <math>\\theta</math> for a given range <math>d_h</math>.  The angle <math>\\theta</math> giving the maximum range can be found by considering the derivative or <math>R</math> with respect to <math>\\theta</math> and setting it to zero.\n\n:<math>{\\mathrm{d}R\\over \\mathrm{d}\\theta}={2v^2\\over g} \\cos(2\\theta)=0</math>\n\nwhich has a nontrivial solution at <math>2\\theta=\\pi/2=90^\\circ</math>, or <math>\\theta=45^\\circ</math>. The maximum range is then <math>R_{\\max} = v^2/g\\,</math>. At this angle <math>\\sin(\\pi/2)=1</math>, so the maximum height obtained is <math>{v^2 \\over 4g}</math>.\n\nTo find the angle giving the maximum height for a given speed calculate the derivative of the maximum height <math>H=v^2 \\sin^2(\\theta) /(2g)</math> with respect to <math>\\theta</math>, that is\n<math>{\\mathrm{d}H\\over \\mathrm{d}\\theta}=v^2 2\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) /(2g)</math>\nwhich is zero when <math>\\theta=\\pi/2=90^\\circ</math>. So the maximum height <math>H_\\mathrm{max}={v^2\\over 2g}</math> is obtained when the projectile is fired straight up.\n\n===Orbiting objects===\nIf instead of a uniform downwards gravitational force we consider two bodies [[orbit]]ing with the mutual gravitation between them, we obtain [[Kepler\'s laws of planetary motion]]. The derivation of these was one of the major works of [[Isaac Newton]] and provided much of the motivation for the development of [[differential calculus]].\n\n==Catching balls==\nIf a projectile, such as a baseball or cricket ball, travels in a parabolic path, with negligible air resistance, and if a player is positioned so as to catch it as it descends, he sees its angle of elevation increasing continuously throughout its flight. The tangent of the angle of elevation is proportional to the time since the ball was sent into the air, usually by being struck with a bat. Even when the ball is really descending, near the end of its flight, its angle of elevation seen by the player continues to increase. The player therefore sees it as if it were ascending vertically at constant speed. Finding the place from which the ball appears to rise steadily helps the player to position himself correctly to make the catch. If he is too close to the batsman who has hit the ball, it will appear to rise at an accelerating rate. If he is too far from the batsman, it will appear to slow rapidly, and then to descend.\n\n{{for|a proof of the above statement|Trajectory of a projectile#Catching balls}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aft-crossing trajectory]]\n*[[Displacement (geometry)]]\n*[[Galilean invariance]]\n*[[Orbit (dynamics)]]\n*[[Orbit (group theory)]]\n*[[Orbital trajectory]]\n*[[Planetary orbit]]\n*[[Porkchop plot]]\n*[[Projectile motion]]\n*[[Range of a projectile]]\n*[[Rigid body]]\n*[[World line]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|High school physics|Projectile motion}}\n* [http://www.physics-lab.net/applets/projectile-motion Projectile Motion Flash Applet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914030742/http://www.physics-lab.net/applets/projectile-motion |date=14 September 2008 }}:)\n* [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/traj.html Trajectory calculator]\n* [http://www.phy.hk/wiki/englishhtm/ThrowABall.htm An interactive simulation on projectile motion]\n* [http://ezyang.com/projectilelab/ Projectile Lab, JavaScript trajectory simulator]\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ParabolicProjectileMotionShootingAHarmlessTranquilizerDartAt/ Parabolic Projectile Motion: Shooting a Harmless Tranquilizer Dart at a Falling Monkey] by Roberto Castilla-Meléndez, Roxana Ramírez-Herrera, and José Luis Gómez-Muñoz, [[The Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n* [http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Trajectory.html Trajectory], ScienceWorld.\n*[http://www.geogebra.org/en/upload/files/nikenuke/projectile06d.html Java projectile-motion simulation, with first-order air resistance.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703000342/http://www.geogebra.org/en/upload/files/nikenuke/projectile06d.html |date=3 July 2012 }}\n*[http://www.geogebra.org/en/upload/files/nikenuke/projTARGET01.html Java projectile-motion simulation; targeting solutions, parabola of safety.]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ballistics]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]'}]}}
