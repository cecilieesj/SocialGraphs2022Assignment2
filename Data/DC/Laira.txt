Much of the housing here was built around 1900 for employees of the depot. There is a memorial plaque to the men of Laira who died in the [[World War I|Great War]] along Old Laira Road. Also situated on Old Laira Road is the old Police / Fire Station which is currently used as a library. Laira Green Primary school is situated in the area, as well as a disused United Reformed Church.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 19th century, Old Laira Road had constituted the northern shore of Lipson Lake (or Bay), an extensive tidal inlet on the western side of the estuary. This area – on which the railway depot and [[Lipson Co-operative Academy]] now stand – was reclaimed from the estuary and drained, together with Tothill Bay on the south side of higher ground at Mount Gould, upon the completion in 1802 of an [[Levee|embankment]] along the whole western shore of the Laira.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moseley|first1=Brian|title=The Embankment|url=http://www.plymouthdata.info/Embankment.htm|website=The Encyclopaedia of Plymouth History|accessdate=13 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928230325/http://www.plymouthdata.info/Embankment.htm|archivedate=28 September 2013|date=September 2011}}</ref> A new road, laid along this embankment shortly afterwards, from Laira Green to Prince Rock, soon became the main highway into Plymouth from [[Plympton]], [[Exeter]], and beyond, avoiding the often steep and narrow way via Old Laira Road and [[Lipson]] – even though the new route was to remain a [[toll road]] until 1924.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Plymouth, Devon]]\n\n\n{{Devon-geo-stub}}"}]}}
