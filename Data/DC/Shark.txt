Sharks possess a [[wiktionary:heterocercal|heterocercal]] caudal fin in which the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] portion is usually noticeably larger than the [[ventral]] portion. This is because the shark\'s [[vertebral column]] extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. This allows more efficient [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish.

While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are \'\'obligate ram ventilators\'\' and would presumably [[asphyxiate]] if unable to move.

In these sharks, a strip of [[aerobic metabolism|aerobic]] red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a [[countercurrent exchange]] mechanism by a system of [[blood vessel]]s called the [[rete mirabile]] ("miraculous net").

This tissue is behind the [[retina]] and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger [[nocturnal]] adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their [[pupil]]s, like humans, something no [[teleost fish]] can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have [[nictitating membrane]]s. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the [[great white shark]] (\'\'Carcharodon carcharias\'\'), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that [[electroreception|electro-]] and [[chemoreception]] are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark\'s field of vision can swap between [[monocular]] and [[stereoscopic]] at any time.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/vision.htm\n|title=Vision and a Carpet of Light\n|last=Martin\n|first=R.

The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct\'s fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. [[Lamniforme]] sharks practice \'\'[[oophagy]]\'\', where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs. Taking this a step further, [[sand tiger shark]] pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos. The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to [[offspring|brood]] the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The [[whale shark]] is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. [[Squalidae|Dogfish]] have the longest known [[gestation period]] of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. [[Basking shark]]s and [[frilled shark]]s appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.<ref name="Birth"/>\n\n====Oviparity====\nSome species are [[oviparous]], laying their fertilized eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|egg case]] with the consistency of [[leather]] protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. The egg case is commonly called a \'\'[[mermaid\'s purse]]\'\'.

Those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them<ref name="Sleep"/> and as such they are not truly asleep.\n\nSpecies that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the [[spiny dogfish]] that its [[spinal cord]], rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so [[spiny dogfish]] can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species.<ref name="Sleep">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/b_sleep.htm\n|title=How Do Sharks Swim When Asleep?\n|publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research\n|access-date=2006-08-07\n|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64w8k5SxX?url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/b_sleep.htm\n|archive-date=2012-01-24\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref> In 2016 a [[great white shark]] was captured on video for the first time in a state researchers believed was sleep swimming.<ref name="npr">{{cite news |title=Great White Shark Caught On Camera Napping For The First Time |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/03/484562955/great-white-shark-caught-on-camera-napping-for-the-first-time |access-date=16 December 2019 |publisher=NPR |date=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Feeding===\n{{About|shark feeding|the sport of shark feeding|Shark baiting|section=yes}}\n\nMost sharks are [[carnivorous]].<ref name="Feeding"/> [[Basking shark]]s, [[whale shark]]s, and [[megamouth shark]]s have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding [[plankton]]: basking sharks practice [[ram feeding]], whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make [[suction feeding]] more efficient by using the [[luminescent]] tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean.

The [[great white shark|great white]] and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. [[Thresher shark]]s use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and [[sawshark]]s either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostra]].\n\nMany sharks, including the [[whitetip reef shark]] are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey.

Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies.
