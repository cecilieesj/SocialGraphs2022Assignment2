Greenspahn |editor=Lindsay Jones |title=Encyclopedia of Religion |article=Ishmael |volume=7 |year=2005|orig-year=1987 |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |pages=4551–52 |quote=ISHMAEL, or, in Hebrew, Yishmaʿeʾl; eldest son of Abraham. Ishmael\'s mother was Hagar, an Egyptian slave girl whom Sarah gave to Abraham because of her own infertility; in accordance with Mesopotamian law, the offspring of such a union would be credited to Sarah (\'\'Gn\'\'. 16:2). The name \'\'Yishmaʿeʾl\'\' is known from various ancient Semitic cultures and means \'God has hearkened,\' suggesting that a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise. Ishmael was circumcised at the age of thirteen by Abraham and expelled with his mother at the instigation of Sarah, who wanted to ensure that Isaac would be Abraham\'s heir (\'\'Gn\'\'. 21). In the New Testament, Paul uses this incident to symbolize the relationship between Judaism, the older but now rejected tradition, and Christianity (\'\'Gal\'\'. 4:21–31). In the \'\'Genesis\'\' account, God blessed Ishmael, promising that he would be the founder of a great nation and a \'wild ass of a man\' always at odds with others (\'\'Gn\'\'. 16:12). He is credited with twelve sons, described as \'princes according to their  tribes\' (\'\'Gn\'\'. 25:16), representing perhaps an ancient confederacy. The Ishmaelites, vagrant traders closely related to the Midianites, were apparently regarded as his descendants. The fact that Ishmael\'s wife and mother are both said to have been Egyptian suggests close ties between the Ishmaelites and Egypt. According to \'\'Genesis\'\' 25:17, Ishmael lived to the age of 137. Islamic tradition tends to ascribe a larger role to Ishmael than does the Bible. He is considered a prophet and, according to certain theologians, the offspring whom Abraham was commanded to sacrifice (although \'\'surah\'\' 37:99-111 of the Qur\'an never names that son). Like his father Abraham, Ishmael too played an important role in making Mecca a religious center (2:127-129). Judaism has generally regarded him as wicked, although repentance is also ascribed to him. According to some rabbinic traditions, his two wives were Aisha and Fatima, whose names are the same as those of Muhammad\'s wife and daughter. Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arabian peoples. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jMOAQAAMAAJ&q=Ishmael |isbn=9780028657400 }}</ref> including early [[Babylonia]]n and [[Minæan]].<ref name="Catholic1913">{{Cite journal|last=Gigot|first=Francis|title=Ismael|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic%20Encyclopedia%20(1913)/Ismael|journal=Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1913|volume= 8}}</ref> It is a [[theophoric]] name translated literally as "[[El (god)|God]] (El) has hearkened", suggesting that "a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise".<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/>\n\n==Genesis narrative==\n[[File:Pieter Pietersz. Lastman 001.jpg|thumb|The dismissal of Hagar, by [[Pieter Pietersz Lastman]]]]\n\nThe Genesis narrative sees the account of Ishmael\'s life take place through {{bibleref2|Genesis|16,17,21,25|NIV|chapters 16, 17, 21 and 25}}.\n\n===Birth===\nIn {{Bibleverse|Genesis|16|HE}}, the birth of Ishmael was planned by the Patriarch [[Abraham]]\'s first wife, who at that time was known as [[Sarah|Sarai]]. She and her husband Abram (Abraham) sought a way to have children in order to fulfill the [[Abrahamic covenant]] that was established in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|15|HE}}. Sarai was 75 years old and had yet to bear a child. She had the idea to offer her Egyptian handmaiden [[Hagar (biblical person)|Hagar]] to her husband so that they could have a child by her. Abraham took Hagar as his wife and conceived a child with her.<ref>Genesis 16:3-4</ref>\n\nHagar began to show contempt for Sarah, who responded by treating her harshly. Hagar then fled into the desert region between Abraham\'s settlement and Shur. {{Bibleverse|Genesis|16:7-16|HE}} describes the naming of Ishmael, and God\'s promise to Hagar concerning Ishmael and his descendants. This occurred at the well of Beer-lahai-roi, where Hagar encountered the [[Angel of the Lord]], who said to her "Behold, you are with child / And shall bear a son; / You shall call him Ishmael, / For the Lord has paid heed to your suffering."<ref>Genesis 16:11, NJPS.</ref> The Angel commanded Hagar, "Return to your mistress [Sarai] and submit to her."\n\nAbraham was blessed so that his descendants would be as numerous as the dust of the earth. God would make of Ishmael a great nation because he was of the seed of Abraham. However, God told Hagar that her son would be living in conflict with his relatives. When Ishmael was born, Abraham was 86 years old.\n\n===Inheritance, rights and the first circumcision===\n{{See also|Isaac#Hebrew Bible|l1=Account of Isaac in the Hebrew Bible}}\nWhen he was 13 years old, Ishmael was circumcised at the same time as all other males in Abraham\'s household, becoming a part of the [[Brit milah|covenant]] in a mass circumcision. His father Abram, given the new name "Abraham", then 99, was circumcised along with the others ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|17|HE}}).\n\nAt the time of the covenant, God informed Abraham that his wife Sarah would give birth to a son, whom he was instructed to name Isaac. God told Abraham that He would establish his covenant through Isaac, and when Abraham inquired as to Ishmael\'s role, God answered that Ishmael has been blessed and that he "will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation." ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|17|HE}}). God also mentioned that "He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be over (against) everyone, And everyone\'s hand will be against him; And he will live in the presence of his brethren."({{Bibleverse|Genesis|16|HE}}).\n\nA year later, Ishmael\'s half-brother [[Isaac]] was born to Abraham by his first wife Sarah when she was 90 years old ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|17:17|NIV}}), after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|18:11|NIV}}).\n\nOn the day of feasting during which Abraham celebrated the weaning of Isaac, Ishmael was "mocking" or "playing with" Isaac (the Hebrew word {{lang|he|מְצַחֵֽק}}, {{transliteration|he|"meṣaḥeq"}} is ambiguous)<ref name="Whedbee1998">{{cite book|author=J.

Abraham agreed only after God told him that "in Isaac your seed shall be called", and that God would "make a [[Ishmaelites|nation]] of the son of the bondwoman" Ishmael, since he was a descendant of Abraham ({{bibleverse|Genesis|21:11–13|NIV}}), God having previously told Abraham "I will establish My covenant with [Isaac]", while also making promises concerning the [[Ishmaelites|Ishmaelite]] nation ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|17:18–21|NASB}}).\n[[File:Hagar and Ishmael in desert (Grigoriy Ugryumov).jpg|thumb|upright|\'\'Hagar and Ishmael in the Desert\'\', by [[Grigory Ugryumov]] ({{circa|1785}})]]\nAt the age of 14, Ishmael was freed along with his mother. The Lord\'s covenant made clear Ishmael was not to inherit Abraham\'s house and that Isaac would be the seed of the covenant: "Take your son, [[Binding of Isaac|your only son]], whom you love and go to the region of Moriah." (Genesis {{bibleverse-nb|Gen|22:2–8|HE}})\nAbraham gave Ishmael and his mother a supply of bread and water and sent them away. Hagar entered in the wilderness of [[Beer-sheba]] where the two soon ran out of water and Hagar, not wanting to witness the death of her son, set the boy some distance away from herself, and wept. "And God heard the voice of the lad" and sent his angel to tell Hagar, "Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation." And God "opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water", from which she drew to save Ishmael\'s life and her own. "And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer." ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|21:14–21|HE}})\n\n===Descendants===\n{{main|Ishmaelites}}\nAfter roaming the wilderness for some time, Ishmael and his mother settled in the [[Desert of Paran]], where he became an expert in [[archery]].

The wife remained nameless, but we know this would not be for long. One suggestion in Pirqe de Rabbi Eliezer (The Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer), from the eighth century, written probably under Islamic rule, is that Ishmael had two wives named Aisha and Fatima, which happen to be the names of Muhammad\'s wife and daughter, respectively (Pirqe R. El. 30). Rather than coincidence, this could have been a way of emphasizing the close affinity of Islamic peoples with the great prophet and founder. At all events, Ishmael (Isma\'il) became the symbol, representative, and patriarch of the Arab peoples in general and, in virtue of his noble descent and Arabian origins, of Islamic peoples...|isbn=9781467443777}}</ref>\n\nRabbinical commentators in the [[Midrash]] [[Genesis Rabbah]] also say that Ishmael\'s mother Hagar was the Pharaoh\'s daughter, making Ishmael the Pharaoh\'s grandson. This could be why Genesis 17:20 refers to Ishmael as the father of 12 mighty princes. According to Genesis 21:21, Hagar married Ishmael to an Egyptian woman, and if Rabbinical commentators are correct that Hagar was the Pharaoh\'s daughter, his marriage to a woman she selected could explain how and why his sons became princes.\n\nAccording to other Jewish commentators, Ishmael\'s mother Hagar is identified with [[Keturah]], the woman Abraham sought out and married after Sarah\'s death. It is suggested that Keturah was Hagar\'s personal name, and that "Hagar" was a descriptive label meaning "stranger".<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2636/jewish/The-Return-of-Hagar.htm "The Return of Hagar"], commentary on [[Chayei Sarah (parsha)|Parshah Chayei Sarah]], [[Chabad Lubavitch]].</ref><ref>[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/chaye/sha.html "Who Was Ketura?"], [[Bar-Ilan University]]\'s Parashat Hashavua Study Center, 2003.</ref><ref>[http://www.ou.org/torah/ti/5763/chayeisara63.htm "Parshat Chayei Sarah"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113015839/http://www.ou.org/torah/ti/5763/chayeisara63.htm |date=2008-11-13 }}, \'\'Torah Insights\'\', [[Orthodox Union]], 2002.</ref> This interpretation is discussed in the [[Midrash]]<ref>[[Bereshit Rabbah]] 61:4.</ref> and is supported by [[Rashi]], [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Gur Aryeh]], [[Keli Yakar]], and [[Obadiah of Bertinoro]]. Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Itzhaki) argues that "Keturah" was a name given to Hagar because her deeds were as beautiful as incense (Hebrew, \'\'ketoret\'\'), and that she remained chaste (literally "tied her opening", with the verb \'\'tied\'\' in Aramaic being \'\'k-t-r\'\') from the time she was separated from Abraham.\n\nIt is also said that Sarah was motivated by Ishmael\'s sexually frivolous ways because of the reference to his "making merry" (Gen. 21:9), a translation of the Hebrew word "Mitzachek". This was developed into a reference to idolatry, sexual immorality or even murder; some rabbinic sources claim that Sarah worried that Ishmael would negatively influence Isaac, or that he would demand Isaac\'s inheritance on the grounds of being the firstborn. Regarding the word "Mitzachek" (again in Gen. 21:9) The Jewish Study Bible by [[Oxford University Press]] says this word in this particular context is associated with "Playing is another pun on Isaac\'s name (cf. 17.17; 18.12; 19.14; 26.8).

According to Muslim tradition, Ishmael was buried at the [[Al Hijr (Kaaba)|Hijr]] near the Kaaba, inside the [[Sacred Mosque]].<ref>\'\'Encyclopedia of Islam\'\' Volume 4, \'\'Ismail\'\'</ref>\n\nIn [[Islamic theology|Islamic belief]], Abraham prayed to God for a son and God heard his prayer. Muslim exegesis states that Sarah asked Abraham to marry her Egyptian handmaiden Hagar because she herself was barren.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Hagar soon bore Ishmael, who was the first son of Abraham. God then instructed Abraham to take Hagar and Ishmael to the desert and leave them there. He did so, taking them to the location of the Kaaba\'s foundations (which now was in ruins) and as he turned away from Hagar and started to walk away she called out to him and asked "Why are you leaving us here?", to which Abraham didn\'t reply the first two times she asked. She then changed her question and asked "Did God command you to do this?" to which Abraham stopped, turned around, looked back and replied "Yes." She responded, "Then God will provide for us." Abraham then continued on his journey back to Sarah. In the desert, the baby Ishmael cried with thirst.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> His mother placed him in the shade under a bush and went on a frantic search for water, which resulted in her running seven times between the [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Safa and Marwah]] hills trying to find a source of water or a passing caravan she could trade with for water. Hagar, not finding any sources of water and fearing the death of her baby, sat down and cried asking for God\'s help. God sent angel Gabriel to her informing her to lift up her baby and when she did, she noticed that his feet had scratched the ground allowing a spring of water to bubble up to the surface. Hagar quickly shifted the ground to form a well around the spring to contain the water, forming the [[Zamzam well]]. Hagar refilled the bottle with water and gave her baby a drink. This spring became known to caravans that traveled through Arabia and Hagar negotiated deals with them for supplies in exchange for the water. From her actions, the city of Mecca (originally Becca or Baca in Hebrew) grew, and attracted settlers who stayed and provided protection for her and Ishmael as well as being sources of various goods brought in and exchanged with visiting caravans. To commemorate the blessing of the Zamzam well God gave to Hagar and Ishmael, Muslims run between the [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Safa and Marwah]] hills retracing Hagar\'s steps during the rites of [[Hajj]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>\n\nAbraham returned and visited Ishmael at various times throughout his life. At one time, according to a tradition of Muhammad, Abraham had arrived when his son was out and Abraham visited with Ishmael\'s wife. Abraham decided to leave before seeing his son, but based upon the complaints Ishmael\'s wife made in response to his questions, he gave her a message to give to her husband when he returned home, which was "change his threshold." When Ishmael arrived that night, he asked if they had had any visitors, and was informed by his wife of the man who had visited and what he said. Ishmael understood his father and explained to his wife that the visitor was his father and he had been instructed to divorce his wife and find a better one, which Ishmael did. Some time after this, Abraham returned to visit Ishmael and again Ishmael was out. Abraham talked with Ishmael\'s new wife and found her answers indicated faith in God and contentment with her husband. Abraham again had to leave before he saw his son, but left him the message to "keep his threshold." When Ishmael returned that night, he again asked if there had been any visitors and was informed of Abraham\'s visit. Ishmael told his wife who it was that had come to visit and that he approved of her and their marriage.\n\nOn one of his visits to Mecca, Abraham is said to have asked his son to help him build the requested [[Kaaba]].<ref>{{cite quran|2|127|s=r}}</ref> Islamic traditions hold that the Kaaba was first built by [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and that Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Kaaba on the old foundations.<ref>Azraqi, \'\'Akhbar Makkah\'\', vol. 1, pp. 58–66</ref> As Ishmael grew up in [[Arabia]], he is said to have become fluent in [[Arabic]].
