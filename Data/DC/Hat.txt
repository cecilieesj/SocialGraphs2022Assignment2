Some hats have a protective function. As examples, the [[hard hat]] protects construction workers\' heads from injury by falling objects, a British police [[Custodian helmet]] protects the officer\'s head, a [[sun hat]] shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a [[cowboy hat]] protects against sun and rain and an [[ushanka]] fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm. Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the [[mortarboard]], which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies. Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the [[Toque]] worn by chefs, or the [[mitre]] worn by Christian [[bishops]]. Adherents of certain religions regularly wear hats, such as the [[turban]] worn by [[Sikh]]s, or the [[church crown|church hat]] that is worn as a [[Christian head covering|headcovering by Christian women]] during prayer and worship.<ref name="SL">{{cite web |title=What are Church Hats? |url=https://www.southernliving.com/culture/church-hats |publisher=[[Southern Living]] |access-date=10 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514230453/https://www.southernliving.com/culture/church-hats |language=English |quote=Church hats have been a key part of churchgoers’ Sunday best for years, and are still an important aspect of dress in some churches today. The practice of covering one’s head for church originally came from the Bible—1 Corinthians 11:15, to be precise. The simple head covering has been adapted and expanded to become a stylish part of Southern women’s churchgoing attire. At the turn of the century, many Southern ladies wore simple hats to church out of respect, reverence for the service, and continuity with passed-down traditions.

Inches or centimeters may be used depending on the manufacturer. [[Felt]] hats can be stretched for a custom fit. Some hats, like [[hard hat]]s and [[baseball cap]]s, are adjustable. Cheaper hats come in "standard sizes", such as small, medium, large, extra large: the mapping of measured size to the various "standard sizes" varies from maker to maker and style to style, as can be seen by studying various catalogues, such as [[Hammacher Schlemmer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enduroworld.com.au/helmet_sizes.htm |title= Helmet sizes |publisher=Enduroworld.com.au |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325032202/http://www.enduroworld.com.au/helmet_sizes.htm|archive-date=March 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<div class="center">\n{| class="wikitable"\n|+ \'\'\'Hat sizes\'\'\'{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n! size || || || || || Youth S/M  ||Youth L/XL || XXS || XS  ||S  || M  || L  || XL  || XXL  || XXXL\n|-\n!
