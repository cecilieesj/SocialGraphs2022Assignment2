According to Nart Villeneuve, "The idea is to get (users) to install this on their computer, and then deliver the location of that circumventor, to people in filtered countries by the means they know to be the most secure. What we\'re trying to build is a network of trust among people who know each other, rather than a large tech network that people can just tap into."<ref>{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Boyd |title=Bypassing China\'s net firewall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3548035.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-03-10 |access-date=2007-03-28}}</ref> Psiphon 1.0 was launched by the Citizen Lab on 1 December 2006 as open-source software.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://psiphon.ca/?page_id=94 |title=Psiphon{{snd}} Total Delivery Solution for the Censored Internet |publisher=Psiphon.ca |access-date=2012-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2007, Psiphon, Inc. was established as a Canadian corporation independent of the Citizen Lab and the University of Toronto.
