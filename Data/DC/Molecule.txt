Refined over time by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Amedeo Avogadro]], [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]], and [[Linus Pauling]], the study of molecules is today known as [[molecular physics]] or molecular chemistry. \n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass. The word is derived from French \'\'{{linktext|molécule}}\'\' (1678), from [[New Latin]] \'\'{{linktext|molecula}}\'\', diminutive of Latin \'\'{{linktext|moles}}\'\' "mass, barrier". The word, which until the late 18th century was used only in Latin form, became popular after being used in works of philosophy by [[René Descartes|Descartes]].<ref>{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary |title=molecule |dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]] |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule |access-date=22 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224223305/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule |archive-date=24 February 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of molecular theory}}\n\nThe definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.<ref>[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013143129/http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule|date=13 October 2014}} ([[Frostburg State University]])</ref> This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.\n\nThe modern concept of molecules can be traced back towards pre-scientific and Greek philosophers such as [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] who argued that all the universe is composed of [[Atomic theory|atoms and voids]]. Circa 450 BC [[Empedocles]] imagined [[Classical element|fundamental elements]] ([[Fire (classical element)|fire]] ([[File:Fire_symbol_(alchemical).svg|20x20px]]), [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] ([[File:Earth_symbol_(alchemical).svg|20x20px]]), [[Air (classical element)|air]] ([[File:Air_symbol_(alchemical).svg|20x20px]]), and [[Water (classical element)|water]] ([[File:Water_symbol_(alchemical).svg|20x20px]])) and "forces" of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact.\n\nA fifth element, the incorruptible quintessence [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], was considered to be the fundamental building block of the heavenly bodies. The viewpoint of Leucippus and Empedocles, along with the aether, was accepted by [[Aristotle]] and passed to medieval and renaissance Europe. \n\nIn a more concrete manner, however, the concept of aggregates or units of bonded atoms, i.e. "molecules", traces its origins to [[Robert Boyle]]\'s 1661 hypothesis, in his famous treatise \'\'[[The Sceptical Chymist]]\'\', that matter is composed of \'\'clusters of particles\'\' and that chemical change results from the rearrangement of the clusters.  Boyle argued that matter\'s basic elements consisted of various sorts and sizes of particles, called "corpuscles", which were capable of arranging themselves into groups. In 1789, [[William Higgins (chemist)|William Higgins]] published views on what he called combinations of "ultimate" particles, which foreshadowed the concept of [[valency bonds]].  If, for example, according to Higgins, the force between the ultimate particle of oxygen and the ultimate particle of nitrogen were 6, then the strength of the force would be divided accordingly, and similarly for the other combinations of ultimate particles.\n\n[[Amedeo Avogadro]] created the word "molecule".<ref name="ley196606">{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=June 1966 |title=The Re-Designed Solar System |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n05_1966-06#page/n93/mode/2up |department=For Your Information |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=94–106}}</ref> His 1811 paper "Essay on Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies", he essentially states, i.e. according to [[J.

Pauling, however, wasn\'t satisfied with this method and looked to the newly emerging field of quantum physics for a new method. In 1926, French physicist [[Jean Perrin]] received the Nobel Prize in physics for proving, conclusively, the existence of molecules.  He did this by calculating [[Avogadro\'s number]] using three different methods, all involving liquid phase systems.  First, he used a [[gamboge]] soap-like emulsion, second by doing experimental work on [[Brownian motion]], and third by confirming Einstein\'s theory of particle rotation in the liquid phase.<ref>Perrin, Jean, B.

Their work was an influence on Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and visited Heitler and London in Zürich on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].\n\nSubsequently, in 1931, building on the work of Heitler and London and on theories found in Lewis\' famous article, Pauling published his ground-breaking article "The Nature of the Chemical Bond"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pauling |first1=Linus |date=1931 |title=The nature of the chemical bond.

On these concepts, Pauling developed [[hybridization theory]] to account for bonds in molecules such as CH<sub>4</sub>, in which four sp³ hybridised orbitals are overlapped by [[hydrogen]]\'s \'\'1s\'\' orbital, yielding four [[Sigma bond|sigma (σ) bonds]]. The four bonds are of the same length and strength, which yields a molecular structure as shown below:\n[[File:Ch4_hybridization.svg|center|thumb|200x200px|A schematic presentation of hybrid orbitals overlapping hydrogens\' s orbitals]]\n\n== Molecular science ==\n\nThe science of molecules is called \'\'molecular chemistry\'\' or \'\'[[molecular physics]]\'\', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more atoms. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term \'\'unstable molecule\'\' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].\n\n== Prevalence ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2022}}\nMolecules as components of matter are common. They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. Most organic substances are molecules. The substances of life are molecules, e.g. proteins, the amino acids of which they are composed, the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), sugars, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins. The nutrient minerals are generally ionic compounds, thus they are not molecules, e.g. iron sulfate.\n\nHowever, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth are made partly or completely of crystals or ionic compounds, which are not made of molecules. These include all of the minerals that make up the substance of the Earth, sand, clay, pebbles, rocks, boulders, [[Crust (geology)|bedrock]], the [[Mantle (geology)|molten interior]], and the [[Earth core|core of the Earth]]. All of these contain many chemical bonds, but are \'\'not\'\' made of identifiable molecules.\n\nNo typical molecule can be defined for salts nor for [[network solid|covalent crystals]], although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]], e.g. [[graphene]]; or three-dimensionally e.g. [[diamond]], [[quartz]], [[sodium chloride]]. The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most metals which are condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing. Thus solid metals are not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es, which are solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state, the atoms are held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating unit-cellular-structure that characterizes salts, covalent crystals, and metals.\n\n== Bonding ==\nMolecules are generally held together by [[covalent bonding]]. Several non-metallic elements exist only as molecules in the environment either in compounds or as homonuclear molecules, not as free atoms: for example, hydrogen.\n\nWhile some people say a metallic crystal can be considered a single giant molecule held together by [[metallic bonding]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harry |first1=B.

However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.\n\nThe empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.\n\nThe [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the chemical formula and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (<sup>12</sup>[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom.

Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Molecular geometry ==\n{{Main|Molecular geometry}}\n\n[[File:Cyanostar STM.png|thumb|left|upright|Structure and [[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] image of a "cyanostar" [[dendrimer]] molecule.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C4CC03725A|pmid=25080328|title=Anion-induced dimerization of 5-fold symmetric cyanostars in 3D crystalline solids and 2D self-assembled crystals|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=50|issue=69|pages=9827–30|year=2014|last1=Hirsch|first1=Brandon E.|last2=Lee|first2=Semin|last3=Qiao|first3=Bo|last4=Chen|first4=Chun-Hsing|last5=McDonald|first5=Kevin P.|last6=Tait|first6=Steven L.|last7=Flood|first7=Amar H.|url=https://zenodo.org/record/889879|access-date=20 April 2018|archive-date=31 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210331062049/https://zenodo.org/record/889879|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\nMolecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.\n\n== Molecular spectroscopy ==\n{{Main|Spectroscopy}}\n\n[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H<sub>2</sub>TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H<sub>2</sub>TPP and TPP molecules.

Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule\'s energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].<ref name="iupac2">{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>\nSpectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, electrons, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).\n\n[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures the vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.\n\n== Theoretical aspects ==\n\nThe study of molecules by molecular physics and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the chemical bond. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].\n\nWhen trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is \'\'sufficiently stable\'\' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".<ref name="iupac" /> This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He<sub>2</sub>]], which has one vibrational bound state<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J.

Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist\'s way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[Atom]]\n* [[Chemical polarity]]\n* [[Chemical structure]]\n* [[Covalent bond]]\n* [[Diatomic molecule]]\n* [[List of compounds]]\n* [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules]]\n* [[Molecular biology]]\n* [[Molecular design software]]\n* [[Molecular engineering]]\n* [[Molecular geometry]]\n* [[Molecular Hamiltonian]]\n* [[Molecular ion]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n* [[Molecular promiscuity]]\n* [[Molecular orbital]]\n* [[Non-covalent bonding]]\n* [[Periodic systems of small molecules]]\n* [[Small molecule]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Van der Waals molecule]]\n* [[World Wide Molecular Matrix]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Chemistry|Biology|Physics}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikimedia|collapsible=true|c=Category:Molecules|voy=no|wikt=molecule|v=no|n=no|q=Molecule|s=Molecule|b=no|species=no|d=Q11369}}\n* [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/motm.htm Molecule of the Month{{snds}}School of Chemistry, University of Bristol]\n\n{{Composition}}\n{{Molecules detected in outer space}}\n{{Particles}}\n{{Branches of chemistry}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Molecular physics| ]]\n[[Category:Molecules| ]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Matter]]'}]}}
