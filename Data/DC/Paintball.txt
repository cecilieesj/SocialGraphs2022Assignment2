However, almost every player will utilize three basic pieces of equipment:\n* [[Paintball marker]]: also known as a "paintball gun", this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the opposing player with [[paintballs]]. The paintball gun must have a [[Paintball equipment#Hoppers/Loaders|loader or "hopper"]] or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a [[compressed air]] tank or [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable metal {{convert|12|g|adj=on}} CO<sub>2</sub> cartridges also used by [[pellet gun]]s. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and semi-automatic operation.<ref>{{cite web|title=How semi-automatic paintball guns work (animation)|url=http://www.mayhem-paintball.co.uk/news/how-semi-automatic-paintball-guns-work|website = mayhem-paintball.co.uk}}</ref><ref name="Paintball X3: Auto-cockers">{{cite web |url=http://history.paintballx3.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121:the-80s-part-22-auto-cockers&catid=35:the-the-game-a-industry&Itemid=2 |title=The 80s Part 25: Auto-cockers |access-date=May 21, 2012 |publisher=Paintball X3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410080914/http://history.paintballx3.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121%3Athe-80s-part-22-auto-cockers&catid=35%3Athe-the-game-a-industry&Itemid=2 |archive-date=April 10, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Paintball X3: Gear History">{{cite web|url=http://history.paintballx3.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=174&Itemid=58 |title=Gear History 1981-2000 |access-date=May 21, 2012 |author=Davidson, Steve |publisher=Paintball X3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305210633/http://history.paintballx3.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=174&Itemid=58 |archive-date=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> Further improvements included increased rates of fire; [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) tanks from 100 to 1,180 ml (3.5 to 40 US fluid ounces), and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 34,000 kPa (5,000 psi). The use of unstable CO<sub>2</sub> causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of such markers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n* [[Paintball equipment#Paintballs|Paintballs]] (pellets): Paintballs, the [[ammunition]] used in the marker, are spherical [[gelatin]] [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] containing primarily [[polyethylene glycol]], other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs is dependent on the brittleness of the ball\'s shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. The highest-grade paintballs incorporate cornstarch and metallic flake into the fill to leave a thick glittery "splat" that is very obvious against any background color, and hard to wipe off. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradable. All ingredients used in the making of a paintball are food-grade quality and are harmless to the participants and environment. Manufacturers and distributors have been making the effort to move away from the traditional oil-based paints and compressed CO<sub>2</sub> gas propellant, to a more friendly water-based formula and compressed air in an effort to become more "eco-friendly". Paintballs come in a variety of sizes, including of 13mm (0.50&nbsp;in) and 17mm (0.68&nbsp;in).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bzpaintball.co.uk/blog/the-different-grades-of-paint/|title=The Different Grades Of Paintballs|last=BZ Paintball}}</ref>\n* [[Paintball equipment#Masks|Mask or goggles]]: Masks are safety devices players are required to wear at all times on the field, to protect them from paintballs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theorion.com/features/aiming-to-please-paintball-club-geared-toward-beginners-1.347002|title=Aiming to please: Paintball Club geared toward beginners|access-date=October 31, 2014|date=September 2, 2009|publisher=The Orion|last = Barrett|first = Lindsey|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090907165905/http://www.theorion.com/features/aiming-to-please-paintball-club-geared-toward-beginners-1.347002|archive-date = September 7, 2009|url-status = dead}}</ref> The original equipment used by players were safety goggles of the type used in labs and wood shops; today\'s goggles are derived from skiing/snowboarding goggles, with an attached shell that completely covers the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of the wearer. Masks can also feature throat guards. Modern masks have developed to be less bulky compared with older designs. Some players may remove the mouth and/or ear protection for aesthetic or comfort reasons, but this is neither recommended nor often allowed at commercial venues. A good paintball mask will protect the eyes from vision distortion caused by fogging, glare, and scratches. Players who do not wear a paintball mask can suffer serious injury.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-07-03 |title=it\'s only a paintball blog: Paintballing guide - IOP |url=https://itsonlypaintball.com/ |access-date=2022-09-19 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAdditional equipment, commonly seen among frequent players, tournament participants, and professional players include:\n* Pods and pod packs: The most common addition to the above "mandatory" equipment, \'\'pods\'\' are plastic containers, usually with flip-open lids, that store paintballs in a ready-to-use manner. Pods are available in many sizes, including 10, 80, 100 and 140-round sizes, with the larger 140-round pods being most common among tournament players. Pods are carried by the player in \'\'pod packs\'\' or \'\'harnesses\'\' which facilitate easy access to the pods during play. There are several designs of pod packs, from belt loops allowing a recreational player to carry one or two extra pods, to harness designs generally designed for either tournament-style or scenario-style players.\n* [[Squeegee]]/swab – From time to time, a paintball will break inside the player\'s marker. When this happens it coats the inner surfaces of the marker with paint, especially the barrel, which considerably reduces accuracy. While speedball and tournament players generally have no time to clear this obstruction and instead simply "shoot through it", woodsball and scenario players generally carry a tool to allow them to clear the barrel following a break. There are several types of squeegee, most of which are advantageous in two of three areas and disadvantageous in the last: cleaning time, effectiveness, and storage space.\n* Paintball jerseys and pants: Originally derived from motocross and BMX attire, tournament players commonly wear special outer clothing with integrated padding that allows the player a free range of motion, and helps protect the player both from paintball hits and from incidental contact with rocks and hard ground. Certain designs of jersey and pant even advertise lower incidence of hits, due to increased "bounce-offs" and "breakaways". In indoor fields, where shooting generally happens at very close range, hard-shelled armor is sometimes worn to protect the player from bruising and welts from close-range hits.\n* Elbow and knee pads: Common among outdoor sports, players can choose to help protect knee, elbow and even hip joints from jarring impact with the use of pads. For paintball, these pads are generally soft foam worn inside a player\'s pants to prevent abrasion of the pad against the ground.\n* Gloves: Paintball impacts to the hands, knuckles and fingers can be extremely painful and temporarily debilitating.  Outdoors, players are often prone or crawling which can cause scrapes to the hands. Padded or armored gloves help reduce the potential for injury to the hands. These gloves are generally referred to as "tactical gloves" and their purpose is to protect the player\'s hands while maintaining dexterity.\n* [[jockstrap|Athletic supporter]]: Also called a jockstrap with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]]. Players generally take care to protect sensitive or vulnerable anatomical areas from painful hits and injury; men commonly wear an athletic supporter with a rigid cup similar to types used in cricket, American football, lacrosse, hockey or baseball, while women often wear a pelvic protector and a padded or hard-shelled sports bra also commonly seen in the aforementioned sports.\n* Other paint marking equipment: Normally seen in scenario play only, and disallowed at all tournaments, other forms of paint-marking equipment are sold, such as paint-grenades (paint-filled balloons or lengths of surgical hose).\n* Vehicles: Again normally only seen in scenario play, a variety of vehicles have been devised based on go-karts, pickup trucks, ATVs, small off-road vehicles, etc. to create "armored vehicles", within which players are protected from hits and can move around on the field. Such vehicles may employ a wide range of mounted paint-discharging weaponry.\n* Hats/Toques/Bandanas: Commonly worn by all levels of players to protect the forehead from direct paintball hits, and stop sweat from running down in to the mask.\n* Remote lines: Used to increase maneuverability, a remote line is a high- pressure hose connecting the fuel tank to the marker allowing the tank to be stored in a backpack or harness. It is mostly found in Mil-Sim, woodsball and scenario events.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Competitive Paintball.png|thumb|Two players after a round of competitive paintball.]]\nPaintball is played with a potentially limitless [[Paintball variations|variety of rules and variations]], which are specified before the game begins. The most basic game rule is that players must attempt to accomplish a goal without being shot and marked with a paintball. A variety of different rules govern the legality of a hit, ranging from "anything counts" (hits cause elimination whether the paintball broke and left a mark or not) to the most common variation: the paintball must break and leave a mark the size of a US quarter or larger. Eliminated players are expected to leave the field of play; eliminations may also earn the opposing team points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zb4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6957,13377142&dq=basic+paintball+rules|title=Paintball Planet features competitive fun|publisher=Cherokee County Herald|access-date=September 16, 2009|author=McCarthy, Chris}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paintball-apl.com/APL%202003%20Rules%2004-03-03.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030502081811/http://www.paintball-apl.com/APL%202003%20Rules%2004-03-03.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 2, 2003 |title=APL Rules |access-date=July 11, 2012 }}</ref> Depending on the agreed upon game rules, the player may return to the field and continue playing, or is eliminated from the game completely.\n\nThe particular goal of the game is determined before play begins; examples include \'\'[[capture the flag]]\'\'<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/20/business/the-executive-life-the-satisfying-silliness-of-the-paintball-wars.html|title=The Executive Life; The Satisfying Silliness Of the Paintball Wars|access-date=September 15, 2009|author=Billard, Mary|date=October 20, 1991|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref> and \'\'elimination\'\'.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/01/13/indoor_paintball_site_targets_the_rapid_growth_of_sport/|title=Indoor paintball site targets the rapid growth of sport|access-date=September 15, 2009|date=January 13, 2005|author=Ewing, Bill|newspaper=The Boston Globe}}</ref> Paintball has spawned popular variants, including [[woodsball]], which is played in the natural environment and spans across a large area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dennews.com/media/storage/paper309/news/2007/09/28/TheVerge/Paintball.Addictive.To.Players-2998458.shtml|publisher=The Daily Eastern News|title=Paintball addictive to players|author=Peters, Kristina|access-date=September 15, 2009|date=September 28, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023010928/http://media.www.dennews.com/media/storage/paper309/news/2007/09/28/TheVerge/Paintball.Addictive.To.Players-2998458.shtml|archive-date=October 23, 2010}}</ref> Conversely, the variant of [[speedball (paintball)|speedball]] is played on a smaller field and has a very fast pace with games as brief as two minutes fifteen seconds in the (NSL) or lasting up to twenty minutes in the PSP (Paintball Sports Promotions).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2006-07-07/Sports/020.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126150440/http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2006-07-07/Sports/020.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 26, 2010|title=Paintball\'s popularity continues to spread|access-date=April 7, 2010|author=Gase, Thomas|publisher=Simi Valley Acorn}}</ref> Another variant is [[scenario paintball]], in which players attempt to recreate historical, or fictional settings.\n\n=== Tournament ===\nTournaments are skill based competitions. These are often bracket tournaments with 5 person teams, taking place on [[Speedball (paintball)]] fields. Tournaments such as the NXL hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States with a range of skill divisions. Other series such as the Ultimate Woodsball League (UWL) play tournaments with large teams on large wooded fields. The types of tournaments and applicable skill divisions vary wildly to serve the diverse interest of paintball competitors.\n\n=== Speedball ===\n{{Main|Speedball (paintball)}}\nSpeedball is played in an open field that could be compared to a soccer field, it is flat with a minimum of natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some "give" to the obstacles for increased safety. This style of play was often referred to as "Hyperball". Eventually, inflatable fabric "bunkers" were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as "snake" and "can" bunkers. Often referred to as "Airball", the use of these inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields.\n\n=== Woodsball ===\n{{Main|Woodsball}}\nWoodsball, or "Bushball", is a fairly recent term that refers to what was the original form of the game:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prospaintball.com/history-of-paintball/|title=The Complete History of Paintball - Everything We Know!|date=2019-08-31|website=ProsPaintball.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> teams competing in a wooded or natural environment, in which varying amounts of stealth and concealment tactics can offer an advantage. The term is commonly used as a synonym for specialized scenario-based play, but it technically refers to virtually any form of paintball played in fields primarily composed of natural terrain and cover such as trees and berms, instead of manmade obstacles. Usually the gamemode is \'\'team death match\'\' although some times it is \'\'capture the flag\'\', or \'\'protect the president\'\' (where one player is chosen as the "president", the president\'s team must protect the president, the enemy team must eliminate the president).\n\n=== Scenario ===\n{{Main|Scenario paintball}}\nCommonly referred to as "Big Games" or "Scenario Games". "Big Games" refer to territory control based gameplay, while a "Paintball Scenario" refers to a game where tasks are given to each side at timed intervals. Pioneered by Wayne Dollack, "Scenario Paintball" focus much more heavily on Live Action Roleplaying events, elevating their immersion, storyline, and game play mechanics above the paintball aspect of play. Many variations and combinations of these games are currently played and are unique to each event and event producer. The game uses the entire venue it is at, combining all normal gaming fields into 1 large playing area. Popular examples of the scenario format are Paintball\'s Grand Finale \nat Wayne\'s World (Ocala, Florida), Cousin\'s Big Game in Coram, New York (on Long Island), Hell Survivor\'s Monster Game (just outside Pinckney, Michigan), Invasion of Normandy at Skirmish U.S.A in Pennsylvania, [[Oklahoma D-Day]] (in Wyandotte, Oklahoma), Fight For Asylum at PRZ Paintball (Picton, Ontario), Battle Royale at Flag Raiders Paintball (Kitchener, Ontario), the Sherwood Classic at Sherwood Forest (La Porte, Indiana), and Free Finale at Low Country Paintball (Ludowici, GA) events which draws in 100 to 5000 players and run at least 6 hours of uninterrupted play, most often averaging 12 hours of play in 2 days. "True24" scenario events run at least 24 hours continuously, the most recent one taking place in May 2019 at Sherwood Forest. These formats vary widely and are frequently historical MilSim, movie, or pop culture themed.\n\n=== MilSim ===\n[[MilSim]] ("Military Simulation") is a mode of play designed to create an experience closer to military reality, where the attainment of specific objectives is the most important aspect of the game.\n\nMilSim addresses the logistics of combat, mission planning and execution, and dealing with limited resources and ammunition. Players are typically eliminated from the game when struck by paint just like in any traditional game of paintball. MilSim is a popular gamemode also played in Airsoft, which is a similar sport to paintball.\n\nWith the advent of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the resulting development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM realism was gained.  Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no different from any other paintball marker, with one exception.  Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine from the bottom of the marker.  The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same.  The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which in turn has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSim environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airsplat.com/MilSim|title=Airsoft MilSim - Military Simulation|website=www.airsplat.com|access-date=2016-05-11|archive-date=2016-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513102125/http://www.airsplat.com/MilSim|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== MFOG ===\nMag-Fed Only Game. An increasingly popular style of game play that forbids bulk loading devices such as the traditional paintball "hopper" or "loader" and under or back mounted bulk loaders such as the Dye BoxRotor, Maxxloader backpack, and AGD Warp Feed. In this style of play all markers must accept a magazine, greatly limiting paint capacities and creating a type of paintball much more similar to popular First Person Shooter video games.\n\n=== Time Trials ===\nA single player paintball attraction in which participants move through a closed course and shoot at a succession of targets. Runs are timed and competition among players is through a leader board, competing to be the quickest.\n\n=== Zombie Hunt ===\nA static (or mobile) entertainment attraction. Venue staff are padded up and dressed as zombies. Paintball markers are mounted to a flat bed trailer. Participants are taken on a "Haunted Hay Ride" style attraction, towed through the property, where they defend themselves from the zombie hordes with paintballs. Generally, black lights and glow in the dark paintballs are used as ammo.\n\n=== Enforcement of game rules ===\nRegulated games are overseen by [[referees]] or [[marshals]], who patrol the course to ensure enforcement of the rules and the safety of the players.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paintball Risk Assessement{{sic|nolink=yes}}|url=http://www.mayhem-paintball.co.uk/about/Risk%20Assessement%20for%20Mayhem%20Paintballing%20London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517101828/http://www.mayhem-paintball.co.uk/about/Risk%20Assessement%20for%20Mayhem%20Paintballing%20London |archive-date=May 17, 2019}}</ref> If a player is marked with paint, they will call them out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the [[code of conduct|honor code]]; a broken ball means elimination.

More generally, within any given area of the park, either all players\'/spectators\'/officials\' masks must be on, or all players\' markers must either have a barrel block in place or be disconnected from their gas source, to ensure that a paintball cannot be fired from any nearby marker and cause eye injury. Some fields encourage players to aim away from opponents\' heads during play if possible; splatter from mask hits can penetrate ventilation holes in the goggles and cause eye irritation, close-range hits to the mask can cause improperly maintained lenses to fail, and hits to unprotected areas of the face, head and neck are especially painful and can cause more serious injury.<ref>Paintball Shooting Tactics at ExtremeSports101 - \'\'Getting a head shot looks cool and because there’s so much hard surface, there’s a good chance that the paint will break. However, there are definite downsides to going for an opponent’s head. There’s also a good chance that the player will end up eating some paint or - worse yet - get hit in the neck, which is quite painful. If players don’t change their lenses as often as they should (and few players do!), a hit to the lenses may cause them to break.\'\'</ref>\n* \'\'\'Minimum distance\'\'\' – When being tagged, depending on the distance from where the shot was fired, a direct paintball impact commonly causes bruises. In certain areas and at close range, these impacts may leave welts, or even break the skin and cause bleeding. To decrease these risks and the severity of associated injuries, commercial venues may enforce a minimum distance, such as {{convert|4.5|m|ft}}, within which players cannot shoot an opponent.<ref name="roanoke">{{cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/sports\\wb/83060|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201085529/http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/sports%5Cwb/83060|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 1, 2013|title=Paintball: There\'s a little pain, but it\'s a ball|author=Fowler, Hart|access-date=September 18, 2009|newspaper=The Roanoke Times|date=September 17, 2006}}</ref> Many fields enforce a modified minimum distance \'\'surrender rule\'\'; a player who advances to within minimum range must offer his opponent the chance to surrender before shooting.

The act of shooting a player at close range is colloquially called "bunkering"; it happens most often when a player uses covering fire to force his opponent behind the cover of a bunker, then advances on that bunker while still shooting to eliminate the opponent point-blank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directpaintball.com/article_bunkering101.html |title=Bunkering 101 - Tactics and the Surrender Rule |publisher=Directpaintball.com |access-date=September 13, 2010}}</ref> A tap of the targeted player with the barrel of a marker, sometimes called a "barrel tag", "Murphy" or "tap-out", is generally considered equivalent to marking them with a paintball and is sometimes used in situations where one player is able to sneak up on an opponent to point-blank range.\n* \'\'\'Hits\'\'\' - A player is hit if a paintball leaves a solid mark of a specified minimum size (often nickel- or quarter-sized) anywhere on the player\'s body or equipment. Some variations of paintball don\'t count hits to the gun or the pod pack, or require multiple hits on the arms or legs. Most professional fields and tournaments, though, count any hit on a person, the equipment on their person, or even objects picked up at random from the field. A grey area of "splatter" often occurs when a paintball breaks on a nearby surface and that paint deflects onto the player; this usually does not count as a hit but it can be difficult to tell the difference between significant splatter and a genuine direct hit.\n* \'\'\'Overshooting\'\'\' – Fields may discourage players from \'\'overshooting\'\' (also regarded as \'\'bonus balling\'\', "ramping", "overkill", or \'\'lighting up\'\'), which is to repeatedly shoot an opposing player after he is eliminated from the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dailyuw.com/2001/4/18/ready-aim-paint/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711000718/http://dailyuw.com/2001/4/18/ready-aim-paint/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 11, 2012|title=Ready, Aim, Paint!|author=Santschi, Mark|date=April 18, 2001|access-date=September 21, 2009|newspaper=The Daily of the University of Washington}}</ref> It is also considered overshooting if a player knew the opponent was eliminated but continued to shoot, disregarding the safety of the opposing player and risking dangerous injury to others.\n* \'\'\'Ramping\'\'\' – Ramping is a feature of many electronic markers, where after a certain number of rapid shots or upon a threshold rate-of-fire being achieved by the player, the gun will begin firing faster than the trigger is being pulled. Ramping of rate of fire is prohibited or sharply limited at most paintball fields, however it is allowed in various tournament formats with specific rules governing when and how the marker may ramp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warpig.com/paintball/newbie/dictionary/index3.shtml|title=Warpig.com Paintball Dictionary|date=January 2006|publisher=Warpig.com via Corinthian Media Services|access-date=April 7, 2010}}</ref>\n* \'\'\'Wiping\'\'\' – Players may attempt to cheat by \'\'wiping\'\' paint from themselves, to pretend they were not hit and stay in the game.<ref name="voicepaly">{{cite web|url=http://voice.paly.net/view_story.php?id=3647|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070528195140/http://voice.paly.net/view_story.php?id=3647|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 28, 2007|title=Ready, Aim ...

Various tournament rules state additional penalties for players or teams caught wiping, such as "3-for-1" (calling the wiping player and the nearest three players out) in PSP capture-the-flag, or a prescribed number of "penalty minutes" in XBall.\n* \'\'\'Non-contact\'\'\' - While paintball does involve tagging players with paintball projectiles, this is generally considered the sole point of physical contact between members of opposing teams. Players are generally prohibited from physically contacting other players, such as colliding with them, physically restraining them, and especially using fists, feet, protective gear or the markers themselves to hit other players. Fisticuffs in particular are dangerous not only to the participants but to all players on or off the field, and referees are generally trained to respond immediately and aggressively to stop the fight, and to eject and ban instigators of these fights.\n* \'\'\'Velocity\'\'\' - Though most paintball markers are capable of firing at muzzle velocities of around 300 feet per second (fps), the players\' paintball marker is generally limited to a muzzle velocity of 280 fps for safety reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/mph-paintball-gun-shoot-2565741|title=Exactly How Fast Does a Paintball Gun Fire?}}</ref>\n\n=== Strategy ===\nPlayer and team strategy varies depending on the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents to reduce the number of directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.\n\nA key element of intermediate and advanced strategy is the concept of "firing lanes". These are clear lines of sight between obstacles on the field and thus potentially between opposing players on the field behind them. A lane is "occupied" if at least one player of the opposing team can fire along it, and it\'s "active" if any player is firing along it, friend or foe. Occupied and active lanes hinder player movement as the player risks getting hit and eliminated. Open fields with sparse cover often have long open lanes between most or all bunkers on the field, most of which will be occupied if not active. Therefore, players have to keep track of which lanes to and from their bunker become occupied by the other team, so the player can make sure the bunker is between themselves and the opponent(s). This becomes harder the more occupied firing lanes there are; when most available firing lanes on the field are occupied, each team has to create cover in at least one direction using suppressing fire (rounds sent to the opponent\'s location designed to keep their head down more than to eliminate them). Speedball, which tends to use small open fields with relatively few obstacles, requires each player to use hundreds of paintballs in the course of a game to keep his opponents pinned down, lest he be pinned himself. Conversely, if most firing lanes on the field are clear, players on each team have greater mobility and the use of covering fire to pin an opponent is less useful as the player can stay behind cover while moving long distances, so players tend to fire less and move more to gain clear shots. Urban scenarios and woodsball fields tend to be larger and with more cover, shortening firing lanes and requiring players to move more to get good shots against their opponent.\n\nTypically, strategy is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork will be seen at the beginning of the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and strategy is seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will be trying to do in various situations during the game.\n\n== Playing venues ==\n[[File:Inflatable paintball bunkers.jpg|thumb|right|A "speedball" field consisting of inflatable paintball bunkers]]\n[[File:Paintball Venue in Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|A non-commercial, community paintball field with wooden structures in Mexico, which is used in playing "renegade" or "gotcha" paintball]]\n[[File:Paintball field in median of I-5 north of Castaic, California.JPG|thumb|A paintball field using [[cable reel]]s and shipping crates as features.]]\nPaintball is played at both commercial venues, which require paid admission, and private land; both of which may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.paintballing.co.uk|title = Paintballing LTD|access-date = October 14, 2015}}</ref> and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or [[urban area]], and may involve a historical context.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9008463|title=Video Report – Blountville-based paintball team ranked fifth in nation, heading to World Championships|access-date=October 31, 2014|date=October 7, 2008|publisher=Kingsport Publishing Corporation|work=www.timesnews.net|last = Smith|first = Rain|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013133046/http://timesnews.net/article.php?id=9008463|archive-date = October 13, 2008|url-status = dead}}</ref> Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable [[bunkers]]; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers are little more than air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as "can" and "snake" bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}\n\nCommercial venues may provide amenities such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants\' safety. Some fields are "BYOP" (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online and use it at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players.<ref name="EMRPB">{{cite web|url=http://www.emrpaintball.com/fpo.shtml|title=Field Paint Only Policy – see number 24|access-date=February 16, 2010|publisher=EMR Paintball|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324143022/http://www.emrpaintball.com/fpo.shtml|archive-date=March 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="GATSPLAT">{{cite web|url=http://www.gatsplat.com/fpo.asp|title=FPO?

Within these leagues it is narrowed down further to divisions. There are six divisions from division 5 to division 1 besides various professional leagues.\n\n=== Tournament format ===\nThe nature and timing of paintball events are specified by the league running the tournament, with the league also defining match rules – such as number of players per team (anywhere from 3-7 players per team), or acceptable equipment for use. The number of matches in a tournament is largely defined by the number of available teams playing. However, the NSL offers non-tournament game play where a more traditional game day format has been adopted. Two teams face off at a set time and play only one game per game day in the season as beginners play a 24-minute game and amateur and professionals play a 32-minute game, both requiring 90 minutes to resolve.\n\nA match in a tournament is refereed by a judge, whose authority and decisions are final. Tournament rules can vary as specified by the league, but may include for example – not allowing players to use devices to communicate with other persons during a game, or not allowing players to unduly alter the layout of terrain on the field. In contrast to a casual game designed for fun, a tournament is much stricter and violations of rules may result in penalties for the players or entire teams.<ref name="PSP2009RulesGeneral">{{cite web|url=http://www.pspevents.com/uploads/PSP2009RulesGeneral.pdf |title=PSP Point Rules |date=February 12, 2009 |publisher=PSP Events |access-date=February 18, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThough tournament paintball was originally played in the woods, [[speedball (paintball)|speedball]] became the standard competitive format in the 1990s.<ref name="inthepaint">{{cite web|access-date=December 23, 2009|title=In The Paint|url=http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=13664|author=Alvania, Rebecca|date=May 23, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814162308/http://www2.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=13664|archive-date=August 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://68caliber.com/?p=5940|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709124030/http://68caliber.com/?p=5940|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|title=National Pump League Goes Back To Paintball\'s Roots|date=February 2, 2010|access-date=February 17, 2010|publisher=.68caliber}}</ref> The smaller fields made use of artificial terrain such as bunkers, allowing symmetrical fields that eliminate terrain advantages for either team; woodsball fields having no such guarantee.<ref name="stpetersburgtimes">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pdQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6610,2199580&dq=paintball+tournament+symmetrical&hl=en|title=Styles of play|access-date=February 17, 2010|date=May 18, 2006|publisher=St Petersburg Times}}</ref> Most recently, fields using inflatable bunkers, tethered to the ground with stakes, have become standard for most tournament formats; the soft, yielding bunkers reduce the occurrence of injuries, the bunkers deflate to store in a compact space and anchor to the ground with tent stakes, allowing for temporary fields to be set up and torn down with less impact on the ground underneath, and the arrangement of bunkers can be easily re-configured to maintain novelty of play or to simulate a predetermined field layout for an upcoming event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paintball-tips-and-tricks.com/airball.html |title=Information on Airball |publisher=Paintball-tips-and-tricks.com |access-date=September 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Professional teams ===\n{{Main|List of professional paintball teams}}\nA professional paintball team is one that plays paintball with the financial, equipment or other kind of support of one or more sponsors, often in return for advertising rights.
