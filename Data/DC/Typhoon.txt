For organizational purposes, the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to [[140th meridian west|140°W]]), central (140°W to 180°), and western (180° to 100°E). The [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in [[Japan]], with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in [[Hawaii]] (the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]), the [[Philippines]], and [[Hong Kong]].

Like any tropical cyclone, there are several main requirements for typhoon formation and development: (1) sufficiently warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, (2) atmospheric instability, (3) high [[relative humidity|humidity]] in the lower-to-middle levels of the troposphere, (4) enough [[Coriolis effect]] to develop a [[low-pressure area|low pressure center]], (5) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and (6) a low vertical [[wind shear]]. Although the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms may occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the [[subtropical ridge]] towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of [[Japan]]. The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls, with [[China]] and Japan being less often impacted. However, some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. [[Taiwan]] has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific [[tropical cyclone basin]]s. However, Vietnam recognises its typhoon season as lasting from the beginning of June through to the end of November, with an average of four to six typhoons hitting the country annually.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-29|title=Typhoon and Tropical Cyclone Seasons in Vietnam|url=https://vn.usembassy.gov/typhoon-and-tropical-cyclone-seasons-in-vietnam/|access-date=2022-01-07|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulate in Vietnam|language=en-US|archive-date=2022-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107033323/https://vn.usembassy.gov/typhoon-and-tropical-cyclone-seasons-in-vietnam/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Briefing|first=Vietnam|date=2021-09-15|title=Typhoon Season in Vietnam: How to Prepare Your Business|url=https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/typhoon-season-vietnam-how-to-prepare-your-business.html/|access-date=2022-01-07|website=Vietnam Briefing News|language=en|archive-date=2021-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211216070109/https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/typhoon-season-vietnam-how-to-prepare-your-business.html/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!--\n<ref name="AOML">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A1.html|title=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|access-date=2009-10-19}}</ref>\n<ref name="BOM">{{cite web|url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/bmrc/pubs/tcguide/globa_guide_intro.htm|title=Global Guide to Tropical Cyclone Forecasting|access-date=2009-10-19 | work = (Holland 1993). # Holland, G.J.
