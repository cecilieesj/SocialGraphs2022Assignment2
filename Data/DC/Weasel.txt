The genus \'\'Mustela\'\' includes the [[least weasel]]s, [[polecat]]s, [[stoat]]s, [[ferret]]s and [[European mink]]. Members of this genus are small, active predators, with long and slender bodies and short legs. The family Mustelidae, or mustelids (which also includes [[badger]]s, [[otter]]s, and [[wolverine]]s), is often referred to as the "weasel family". In the UK, the term "weasel" usually refers to the smallest [[species]], the [[least weasel]] (\'\'M.&nbsp;nivalis\'\'),<ref name=SOED>{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0199206872|pages=3804}}</ref> the smallest [[carnivora]]n species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Valkenburgh|first1=Blaire Van|last2=Wayne|first2=Robert K.|date=2010-11-09|title=Carnivores|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=21|pages=R915–R919|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.09.013|pmid=21056828|s2cid=235312150|issn=0960-9822}}</ref>\n\nLeast weasels vary in length from {{convert|173|to|217|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}},<ref name="WeaselSize">{{cite web|url=http://www.mammal.org.uk/species-hub/full-species-hub/full-species-hub-list/species-weasel/|title=The Weasel|publisher=The Mammal Society| access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref> females being smaller than the males, and usually have red or brown upper coats and white bellies; some populations of some species [[moult]] to a wholly white coat in winter.

Their tails may be from {{convert|34|to|52|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="WeaselSize" />\n\nWeasels feed on small mammals and have from time to time been considered [[vermin]] because some species took [[poultry]] from farms or [[rabbit]]s from commercial warrens. They do, on the other hand, eat large numbers of [[rodent]]s. Their range spans [[Europe]], [[North America]], much of [[Asia]] and [[South America]], and small areas in [[North Africa]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe English word "weasel" was originally applied to one [[species]] of the [[genus]], the European form of the [[least weasel]] (\'\'Mustela nivalis\'\'). This usage is retained in [[British English]], where the name is also extended to cover several other small species of the genus. However, in technical discourse and in American usage, the term "weasel" can refer to any member of the genus, or to the genus as a whole. Of the 16 extant species currently classified in the genus \'\'Mustela\'\', 10 have "weasel" in their common names. Among those that do not are the three species of ermine,{{refn|group="*"|These three species are \'\'Mustela erminea\'\', (the  [[Eurasian ermine]] or stoat); \'\'M. haidarum\'\', (the [[Haida ermine]]); and \'\'M. richardsonii\'\', (the [[American ermine]]).}} the [[polecat]]s, the [[ferret]], and the [[European mink]].\n\nThe [[American mink]] and the extinct [[sea mink]] were commonly included in this genus as \'\'Mustela vison\'\' and \'\'Mustela macrodon\'\', respectively, but in 1999 they were moved to the genus \'\'[[Neovison]]\'\'.<ref>Abramov, A.V. 1999.
