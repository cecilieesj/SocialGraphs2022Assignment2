The name "Sturnidae" comes from the [[Latin]] word for starling, \'\'sturnus\'\'. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called [[myna]]s, and many African species are known as [[Lamprotornis|glossy starlings]] because of their [[iridescence|iridescent]] [[Feather|plumage]]. Starlings are native to [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], as well as northern [[Australia]] and the islands of the tropical [[Pacific]]. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as [[North America]], [[Hawaii]] and [[New Zealand]], where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be [[invasive species]]. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the [[common starling]], and throughout much of [[Asia]] and the Pacific, the [[common myna]] is indeed common.\n\nStarlings have strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very [[gregarious]]. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat [[insect]]s and [[fruit]]. Several species live around human habitation and are effectively [[omnivore]]s. Many species search for prey such as [[Beetle#Reproduction and development|grub]]s by "open-bill probing", that is, forcefully opening the bill after inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb \'\'zirkeln\'\' (pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈtsɪʁkl̩n|}}).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=East R.  |author2=R.

Most species nest in holes and lay blue or white [[bird egg|eggs]].\n\nStarlings have diverse and complex vocalizations and have been known to embed sounds from their surroundings into their own calls, including [[car alarm]]s and human speech patterns. The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls and are the subject of research into the evolution of [[human language]].<ref>{{ cite web | last=Zimmer | first=Carl | date=2 May 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/science/02song.html | title=Starlings\' listening skills may shed light on language evolution | work=The New York Times | access-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Starling (5503763150).jpg|thumb|[[Common starling]] (\'\'Sturnus vulgaris\'\') has [[iridescent]] [[plumage]]]]\nStarlings are medium-sized [[passerines]].<ref name="HBW">{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Adrian |last2=Feare |first2=Chris |editor1=del Hoyo, Josep |editor2=Elliott, Andrew |editor3=Christie, David |contribution=Family Sturnidae (Starlings) |title=Handbook of the Birds of the World.

The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to [[iridescence]]; this colour is derived from the structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have [[Crest (feathers)|crests]] or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or, as in the [[Bali starling]], structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibers. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.<ref name="HBW" />\n\n==Distribution, habitat and movements==\n[[File:Chestnut-tailed Starling I IMG 2508.jpg|thumb|[[Chestnut-tailed starling]] is a partial migrant over much of the east of its range, but its movements are poorly understood]]\nStarlings inhabit a wide range of habitats from the [[Arctic Circle]] to the [[Equator]]. In fact, the only habitat they do not typically occupy is the driest sandy deserts. The family is naturally absent from the Americas and from large parts of Australia but is present over the majority of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The genus \'\'[[Aplonis]]\'\' has also spread widely across the islands of the Pacific reaching [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]]<ref name = "HBW"/> (in addition one species in the genus \'\'[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]\'\' has reached the [[Solomon Islands]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Doughty|first=Chris |author2=Day, Nicholas |author3=Andrew Plant|title=Birds of the Solomons, Vanuatu & New Caledonia|publisher=Christopher Helm|location=London|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7136-4690-0}}</ref>). It is also a species of this genus that is the only starling found in northern Australia.<ref name = "HBW"/>\n\nAsian species are most common in evergreen forests; 39 species found in Asia are predominantly forest birds as opposed to 24 found in more open or human modified environments. In contrast to this, African species are more likely to be found in open woodlands and savannah; 33 species are open area specialists compared to 13 true forest species. The high diversity of species found in Asia and Africa is not matched by Europe, which has one widespread (and very common) species and two more restricted species. The [[European starling]] is both highly widespread and extremely catholic in its habitat, occupying most types of open habitat. Like many other starling species, it has also adapted readily to human-modified habitat, including farmland, orchards, plantations, and urban areas.<ref name = "HBW"/>\n\nSome species of starling are [[bird migration|migratory]], either entirely, like the [[Shelley\'s starling]], which breeds in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somaliland]] and migrates to [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Somalia]], or, like the [[white-shouldered starling]], which is migratory in part of its range but is resident in others.<ref name = "HBW"/>\n\nThe [[European starling]] was purposely introduced to North America in the 1870s through the 1890s by multiple [[acclimatisation society|acclimatisation societies]], organizations dedicated to introducing European flora and fauna into North America for cultural and economic reasons.<ref name="Fugate2021">{{cite journal |last1=Fugate |first1=Lauren |last2=Miller |first2=John MacNeill |title=Shakespeare\'s Starlings: Literary History and the Fictions of Invasiveness |journal=Environmental Humanities |date=November 1, 2021 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=301–322 |doi=10.1215/22011919-9320167 |s2cid=243468840 |url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/environmental-humanities/article/13/2/301/234995/Shakespeare-s-StarlingsLiterary-History-and-the |access-date=November 26, 2021 |issn=2201-1919}}</ref> A persistent story alleges that [[Eugene Schieffelin]], chairman of the [[American Acclimatization Society]], decided all birds mentioned by [[William Shakespeare]] should be in North America, leading to the introduction of the starling to the U.S.; however, this claim is more fiction than fact.<ref name="Mirsky">{{cite journal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=call-of-the-reviled|date=May 23, 2008 |journal=Scientific American |title=Shakespeare to blame for introduction of European starlings to U.S |first1=Steve |last1=Mirsky |access-date=November 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Fugate2021 /> While Schieffelin and other members of the society did release starlings in [[Central Park]] in 1890, the birds had already been in the U.S. since at least the mid-1870s, and Schieffelin was not inspired to do so by Shakespeare\'s works.<ref name=Fugate2021 />\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Spectacular Starlings at Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve, Cymru, Wales.webm|thumb|[[Swarm behaviour|Murmuration]] of common starlings at [[Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve]], [[Wales]]]]\nThe starlings are generally a highly social family. Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. \'\'Murmuration\'\' describes the [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] of starlings, including the [[swarm behaviour]] of their large flight formations.<ref name=King2012>{{cite journal |vauthors=King AJ, Sumpter DJ |title=Murmurations |journal=Current Biology |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=R112–4 |date=2012 |pmid=22361142 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.033 |doi-access=free}}</ref> These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is particularly evident in their roosting behaviour; in the non-breeding season some roosts can number in the thousands of birds.<ref name = "HBW"/>\n\n===Mimic ===\nStarlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15–20 distinct imitations. They also imitate a few sounds other than those of wild birds. The calls of abundant species or calls that are simple in frequency structure and show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated. There are local dialects of mimicked sounds.<ref name = "HBW"/>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Aplonis opaca.jpg|thumb|[[Micronesian starling]]s have been observed feeding on the eggs of [[seabird]]s]]\n[[File:2 starlings and a robin on grape arbor. - DPLA - 9cd7742aa67b676375f64c4402dee2c2.jpg|left|thumb|Two starlings and an American robin (right) on grape arbor. The  American robin is plucking a grape. Robins and starlings cause serious damage to ripening grapes in California and elsewhere.]]\nThe diets of the starlings are usually dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in the continents of Asia and Africa, for example, [[Santalum album|white sandalwood]] and [[Ficus benghalensis|Indian banyan]]. In addition to trees they are also important dispersers of [[parasite|parasitic]] [[mistletoe]]s. In South Africa, the [[red-winged starling]] is an important disperser of the [[introduced species|introduced]] \'\'[[Acacia cyclops]]\'\'. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, which led to the speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol.<ref name = "HBW"/> \n\nLaboratory experiments on [[European starling]]s have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Prinzinger |first=R.|author2=Hakimi G.A. |year=1996|title=Alcohol resorption and alcohol degradation in the European Starling \'\'Sturnus vulgaris\'\'|journal=Journal für Ornithologie|volume=137|issue=3|pages=319–327|doi=10.1007/BF01651072|s2cid=31680169}}</ref> In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings will also consume [[nectar]].

The latter are apparently the Sturnidae\'s closest living relatives, replace them in the [[Americas]], and have a rather similar but more solitary lifestyle. They are [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] quite similar too—a partly [[albinistic]] specimen of a mimid, mislabelled as to suggest an Old World origin, was for many decades believed to represent an extinct starling (see [[Rodrigues starling]] for details).\n\n[[File:Starling eggs.jpeg|thumb|[[European starling]] eggs]]\n[[File:Sturnus vulgaris vulgaris 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Adult feeding young]]\n\nThe [[oxpecker]]s are sometimes placed here as a [[subfamily]], but the weight of evidence has shifted towards granting them full family status as a more [[basal (biology)|basal]] member of the Sturnidae-Mimidae group, derived from an early expansion into Africa.\n\nUsually the starlings are considered a family, as is done here.

Establishing a valid name for the [[clade]] consisting of Sibley/Monroe\'s "pan-Sturnidae" would nonetheless be desirable to contrast them with the other major lineages of Muscicapoidea.\n\nStarlings probably originated in the general area of [[East Asia]], perhaps towards the southwestern [[Pacific]], as evidenced by the number of [[plesiomorph]]ic lineages to occur there. Expansion into Africa appears to have occurred later, as most [[Synapomorphy|derived]] forms are found there.

Given the overall evidence for the origin of most [[Passeri]] families in the first half of the [[Miocene]], it appears to be not too far off the mark however.<ref name=zuccon/>\n\nAs of 2007, recent studies<ref name=zuccon/><ref name=cibois/> identified two major [[clade]]s of this family, corresponding to the generally drab, often striped, largish "atypical [[myna]]s" and other mainly Asian-Pacific lineages, and the often smaller, sometimes highly [[apomorph]]ic [[taxa]] which are most common in Africa and the Palearctic, usually have metallic coloration, and in a number of species also bright [[carotinoid]] plumage colors on the underside. Inside this latter group, there is a clade consisting of species which, again, are usually not too brightly colored, and which consists of the "typical" myna-\'\'[[Sturnus]]\'\' assemblage.\n\nThe [[Philippine creeper]]s, a single genus of three species of [[treecreeper]]-like birds appear to be highly [[apomorph]]ic members of the more initial radiation of the Sturnidae.<ref name=zuccon/> While this may seem odd at first glance, their placement has always been contentious. In addition, [[biogeography]] virtually rules out a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem to have ever reached [[Wallacea]], let alone the [[Philippines]]. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually, they may remain a separate family.\n\nGenus sequence follows traditional treatments. This is apparently not entirely correct, with \'\'Scissirostrum\'\' closer to \'\'Aplonis\'\' than to \'\'Gracula\'\' for example, and \'\'[[Acridotheres]]\'\' among the most advanced genera. Too few taxa have yet been studied as regards their relationships, however, and thus a change in the sequence has to wait on further studies.\n\nAs of 2009, the review by Lovette & Rubenstein (2008) is the most recent work on the phylogeny of the group.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lovette, I., McCleery, B., Talaba, A., & Rubenstein, D. |year=2008 |title=A complete species-level molecular phylogeny for the "Eurasian" starlings (Sturnidae: Sturnus, Acridotheres, and allies): Recent diversification in a highly social and dispersive avian group |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=251–260 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2008.01.020 |url=http://www.dustinrubenstein.com/webpage/PUBLICATIONS_files/MPE2008.pdf |pmid=18321732 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205083032/http://www.dustinrubenstein.com/webpage/PUBLICATIONS_files/MPE2008.pdf |archive-date=February 5, 2009 }}</ref> This taxonomy is also based on the order of the [[International Ornithologists\' Union|IOC]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Nuthatches, Wallcreeper, treecreepers, mockingbirds, starlings, oxpeckers – IOC World Bird List|url=https://www.worldbirdnames.org/new/bow/nuthatch/|access-date=2021-07-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Oriental-Australasian clade===\n[[File:Polynesian Starling.jpg|thumb|[[Polynesian starling]], \'\'Aplonis tabuensis\'\', ranges from the [[Solomon Islands]] to [[Tonga]]]]\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Aplonis]]\'\'\'\'\'—Pacific starlings (c. 20 living species, 4–5 recently [[extinct]])\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]\'\'\'\'\'\n** [[Yellow-faced myna]], \'\'Mino dumontii\'\'\n** [[Golden myna]], \'\'Mino anais\'\'\n** [[Long-tailed myna]], \'\'Mino kreffti\'\'\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Basilornis]]\'\'\'\'\'\n** [[Sulawesi myna]], \'\'Basilornis celebensis\'\'\n** [[Helmeted myna]], \'\'Basilornis galeatus\'\'\n** [[Long-crested myna]], \'\'Basilornis corythaix\'\'\n[[File:Beo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Hill myna]]s, \'\'[[Gracula]]\'\' species]]<!-- Check which species this is. -->\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Goodfellowia]]\'\'\'\'\'<nowiki/>\'\'—\'\'[[Apo myna]]\n*\'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Sarcops]]\'\'\'\'\'—Coleto\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Streptocitta]]\'\'\'\'\'\n** [[White-necked myna]], \'\'Streptocitta albicollis\'\'\n** [[Bare-eyed myna]], \'\'Streptocitta albertinae\'\'\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Enodes]]\'\'\'\'\'—fiery-browed myna\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Scissirostrum]]\'\'\'\'\'—finch-billed myna\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Ampeliceps]]\'\'\'\'\'—golden-crested myna\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Gracula]]\'\'\'\'\'—hill mynas (five to six species)\n*\'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Acridotheres]]\'\'\'\'\'—typical mynas (10 species)\n*\'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Spodiopsar]]\'\'\'\'\' (2 species)\n*\'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Gracupica]]\'\'\'\'\'— 4 species\n*\'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Agropsar]]\'\'\'\'\' (sometimes included in \'\'Sturnus\'\' or \'\'Sturnia\'\') (2 species)\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Sturnia]]\'\'\'\'\' (sometimes included in \'\'Sturnus\'\')\n** [[White-shouldered starling]], \'\'Sturnia sinensis\'\'\n** [[Chestnut-tailed starling]], \'\'Sturnia malabarica\'\'\n** [[White-headed starling]], \'\'Sturnia erythropygia\'\'\n** [[Malabar starling]], \'\'Sturnia blythii\'\'\n** [[Brahminy starling]], \'\'Sturnia pagodarum\'\'\n*\'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Sturnornis]]\'\'\'\'\'—white-faced starling\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Leucopsar]]\'\'\'\'\'—Bali myna\n*\'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Fregilupus]]\'\'\'\'\'—Réunion starling ([[extinct]], 1850s)\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Necropsar]]\'\'\'\'\'—Rodrigues starling ([[extinct]], late 18th century?)\n\n===Afrotropical-Palearctic clade===\n[[File:Lamprotornis nitens, Kruger.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Cape starling]] (\'\'Lamprotornis nitens\'\')]]\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Rosy starling|Pastor]]\'\'\'\'\'— rosy starling\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Sturnus]]\'\'\'\'\'—typical starlings (2 species)\n** [[Common starling]], \'\'Sturnus vulgaris\'\'\n** [[Spotless starling]], \'\'Sturnus unicolor\'\'\n[[File:CIMG0623.JPG|thumb|African [[superb starling]]]]\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Creatophora]]\'\'\'\'\'—wattled starling\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Notopholia]]\'\'\'\'\' —black-bellied starling\n*\'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Hylopsar]]\'\'\'\'\' (2 species)\n* \'\'\'Genus \'\'[[Lamprotornis]]\'\'\'\'\'—typical glossy-starlings (23 species;
