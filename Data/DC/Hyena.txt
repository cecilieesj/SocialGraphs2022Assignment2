Both eat food quickly and may store it, and their calloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable claws are adapted for running and making sharp turns.

The first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern [[African civet]]; one of the earliest hyena species described, \'\'[[Plioviverrops]]\'\', was a lithe, civet-like animal that inhabited Eurasia 20–22&nbsp;million years ago, and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure of the [[middle ear]] and dentition. The lineage of \'\'Plioviverrops\'\' prospered, and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws, a direction similar to that taken by canids in [[North America]].<ref name="mac119">{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1992|pp=119–144}}</ref>\nHyenas then diversified into two distinct types: lightly built dog-like hyenas and robust bone-crushing hyenas. Although the dog-like hyenas thrived 15&nbsp;million years ago (with one [[taxon]] having colonised North America), they became extinct after a change in climate, along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia. Of the dog-like hyena lineage, only the insectivorous [[aardwolf]] survived, while the bone-crushing hyenas (including the [[Extant taxon|extant]] spotted, [[brown hyena|brown]] and striped hyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa.<ref name="mac119" />\n\n===Rise and fall of the dog-like hyenas===\n[[File:Ictitherium viverrinum.JPG|left|thumb|Skull of \'\'Ictitherium viverrinum\'\', one of the "dog-like" hyenas. [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]\nThe descendants of \'\'Plioviverrops\'\' reached their peak 15&nbsp;million years ago, with more than 30 species having been identified. Unlike most modern hyena species, which are specialised bone-crushers, these dog-like hyenas were nimble-bodied, wolfish animals; one species among them was \'\'[[Ictitherium]] viverrinum\'\', which was similar to a [[jackal]]. The dog-like hyenas were numerous; in some Miocene fossil sites, the remains of \'\'Ictitherium\'\' and other dog-like hyenas outnumber those of all other carnivores combined. The decline of the dog-like hyenas began 5–7&nbsp;million years ago during a period of climate change, exacerbated by [[canid]]s crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] to Eurasia. One species, \'\'[[Chasmaporthetes|Chasmaporthetes ossifragus]]\'\', managed to cross the land bridge into North America, being the only hyena to do so. \'\'Chasmaporthetes\'\' managed to survive for some time in North America by deviating from the endurance-running and bone-crushing niches monopolized by canids, and developing into a [[cheetah]]-like sprinter. Most of the dog-like hyenas had died off by 1.5&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="mac119" />\n\n===Bone-crushing hyenas===\nBy 10–14&nbsp;million years ago, the hyena family had split into two distinct groups: dog-like hyenas and bone-crushing hyenas. The arrival of the ancestral bone-crushing hyenas coincided with the decline of the similarly built family [[Percrocutidae]]. The bone-crushing hyenas survived the changes in climate and the arrival of canids, which wiped out the dog-like hyenas, though they never crossed into North America, as their niche there had already been taken by the dog subfamily [[Borophaginae]]. By 5&nbsp;million years ago, the bone-crushing hyenas had become the dominant scavengers of Eurasia, primarily feeding on large herbivore carcasses felled by [[sabre-toothed cat]]s. One genus, \'\'[[Pachycrocuta]]\'\', was a 200&nbsp;kg (440&nbsp;lb) mega-scavenger that could splinter the bones of [[elephant]]s.<ref name="mac119" /> With the decline of large herbivores by the late ice age, \'\'Pachycrocuta\'\' was replaced by the smaller \'\'Crocuta\'\'.<ref name="mac119" />\n\n===Rise of modern hyenas===\n[[File:Stripedspottedhyenas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skeletons of a [[striped hyena]] (left) and a [[spotted hyena]] (right), two species of the "bone-crushing" hyenas]]\nThe four extant species are the striped hyena (\'\'Hyaena hyaena\'\'), the brown hyena (\'\'Parahyaena brunnea\'\'), the spotted hyena (\'\'Crocuta crocuta\'\'), and the aardwolf (\'\'Proteles cristata\'\').\n\nThe [[aardwolf]] can trace its lineage directly back to \'\'Plioviverrops\'\' 15&nbsp;million years ago, and is the only survivor of the dog-like hyena lineage. Its success is partly attributed to its insectivorous diet, for which it faced no competition from canids crossing from North America. It is likely that its unrivaled ability to digest the [[terpene]] excretions from soldier [[termite]]s is a modification of the strong digestive system its ancestors used to consume fetid carrion.<ref name="mac119" />\n\nThe [[striped hyena]] may have evolved from \'\'Hyaenictitherium namaquensis\'\' of [[Pliocene]] [[Africa]]. Striped hyena fossils are common in Africa, with records going back as far as the [[Villafranchian]]. As fossil striped hyenas are absent from the [[Mediterranean]] region, it is likely that the species is a relatively late invader to Eurasia, having likely spread outside Africa only after the extinction of [[spotted hyena]]s in Asia at the end of the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]]. The striped hyena occurred for some time in [[Europe]] during the Pleistocene, having been particularly widespread in [[France]] and [[Germany]]. It also occurred in [[Montmaurin]], [[Hollabrunn]] in [[Austria]], the Furninha Cave in [[Portugal]] and the Genista Caves in [[Gibraltar]]. The European form was similar in appearance to modern populations, but was larger, being comparable in size to the [[brown hyena]].<ref name="k66">{{Harvnb|Kurtén|1968|pp=66–68}}</ref>\n\nThe [[spotted hyena]] (\'\'Crocuta crocuta\'\') diverged from the striped and brown hyena 10&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="m1">{{Harvnb|Mills|Hofer|1998|p=1}}</ref> Its direct ancestor was the Indian \'\'Crocuta sivalensis\'\', which lived during the Villafranchian.<ref name="k69" /> Ancestral spotted hyenas probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from rivals on carcasses, thus forcing them to operate in teams. Spotted hyenas evolved sharp [[carnassial]]s behind their crushing premolars, therefore they did not need to wait for their prey to die, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger [[territory (animal)|territories]], necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another [[Hyena clan|clan\'s]] turf.<ref name="mac119" /> Spotted hyenas spread from their original homeland during the [[Middle Pleistocene]], and quickly colonised a very wide area from Europe, to southern Africa and [[China]].<ref name="k69">{{Harvnb|Kurtén|1968|pp=69–72}}</ref> With the decline of grasslands 12,500 years ago, Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. Spotted hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by [[grey wolf|wolves]] and [[human]]s, who were as much at home in forests as in open lands&mdash;and in highlands as in lowlands. Spotted hyena populations began to shrink after roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from [[Western Europe]] between 11 and 14 thousand years ago, and earlier in some areas.<ref name="hyenawolf">{{cite web| url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mstiner/pdf/Stiner2004a.pdf| title=Comparative ecology and taphonomy of spotted hyenas, humans, and wolves in Pleistocene Italy| work=C.

Note the greatly reduced molars and carnassials, rendered redundant from insectivory]]\nHyenas have relatively short torsos and are fairly massive and [[wolf]]-like in build, but have lower hind quarters, high withers and their backs slope noticeably downward towards their rumps. The forelegs are high, while the hind legs are very short and their necks are thick and short. Their skulls superficially resemble those of large canids, but are much larger and heavier, with shorter facial portions. Hyenas are [[digitigrade]], with the fore and hind paws having four digits each and sporting bulging pawpads.<ref name="h3" /> Like canids, hyenas have short, blunt, non-retractable claws.<ref name="p62" /> Their [[Fur|pelage]] is sparse and coarse with poorly developed or absent underfur. Most species have a rich mane of long hair running from the withers or from the head.<ref name="h3">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|1992|p=3}}</ref> With the exception of the spotted hyena, hyaenids have striped coats, which they likely inherited from their viverrid ancestors.<ref name="mac119" /> Their ears are large and have simple basal ridges and no marginal bursa.<ref name="p62" /> Their [[vertebral column]], including the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical region]] are of limited mobility.

The [[carnassial]]s, especially the upper, are very powerful and are shifted far back to the point of exertion of peak pressure on the jaws. The other teeth, save for the underdeveloped upper [[molar (tooth)|molars]], are powerful, with broad bases and cutting edges.
