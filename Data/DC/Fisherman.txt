The total [[fishery]] production of 66 million tonnes equated to an average productivity of 3.5 tonnes per person.<ref name="FAO"/>\n\nMost of this growth took place in [[Asia]]n countries, where four-fifths of world fishers and fish farmers dwell.<ref name="FAO">[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/13827/en \'\'Fishing people\'\']. Retrieved 7 July 2008.</ref>\n\nMost fishers are women and men involved in offshore and deep-sea fisheries. Women and men fish in some regions inshore from small boats or collect [[shellfish]] and [[seaweed]]. In many [[Artisan fishing|artisanal fishing]] communities, women or men are responsible for making and repairing [[Fishing nets|nets]], post-harvest [[Fish processing|processing]] and [[Fish marketing|marketing]].<ref name="FAO"/>\n\n==Recreation==\n{{main|Recreational fishing}}\n\nRecreational fishing is fishing for pleasure or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is fishing for [[Profit (economics)|economic profit]], or [[Artisan fishing|subsistence fishing]], which is fishing for survival.\n\nThe most common form of recreational fishing is done with a [[fishing rod|rod]], [[fishing reel|reel]], [[fishing line|line]], [[fish hook|hooks]] and any one of a wide range of [[Fishing bait|bait]]s. [[Fishing lure|Lures]] are frequently used in place of bait. Some people make handmade lures, including [[Soft plastic bait|plastic lures]] and [[Artificial fly|artificial flies]].\n\nThe practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is called [[angling]], and fishermen using this technique are sometimes referred to as \'\'anglers\'\'. When angling, it is sometimes expected or required that the fish be [[Catch and release|caught and released]]. [[Big-game fishing]] is fishing from boats to catch large open-water species such as [[tuna]], [[shark]]s and [[marlin]]. [[Noodling]] and [[trout tickling]] are also recreational activities.\n\n==Communities==\n{{main|Fishing village|Artisan fishing}}\nFor some [[fishing village|communities]], fishing provides not only a source of food and work but also [[community]] and [[culture|cultural]] identity.<ref>[http://www.icsf.net International Collective in Support of Fishworkers (ICSF)]</ref>\n\n==Safety issues==\n[[File:Royal Navy Sea King Helicopter Comes to the Aid of French Fishing Vessel \'Alf\' in the Irish Sea MOD 45155248.jpg|thumb|A Royal Air Force search and rescue Sea King helicopter comes to the aid of the French fishing vessel \'\'Alf\'\' during a storm in the Irish Sea.]]\n{{see also|Work in Fishing Convention 2007}}\n\nThe [[fishing industry]] is hazardous for fishers. Between 1992 and 1999, US commercial [[fishing vessel]]s averaged 78 deaths per year. The main contributors to fatalities are:<ref name="FAO Profile">[[FAO]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20170518220246/ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/DOCUMENT/fcp/en/FI_CP_US.pdf Profile for the USA] {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121113051023/ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/DOCUMENT/fcp/en/FI_CP_US.pdf |date=2012-11-13 }}</ref>\n* inadequate preparation for emergencies\n* poor vessel maintenance and inadequate safety equipment\n* lack of awareness of or ignoring stability issues.\nMany fishers, while accepting that fishing is dangerous, staunchly defend their independence. Many proposed laws and additional regulation to increase safety have been defeated because fishers oppose them.<ref name="FAO Profile"/>\n\nAlaska\'s commercial fishers work in one of the world\'s harshest environments. Many of the hardships they endure include isolated fishing grounds, high winds, seasonal darkness, very cold water, icing, and short fishing seasons, where very long work days are the norm. Fatigue, physical [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], and financial pressures face most Alaska fishers through their careers. Out of 948 work-related deaths that took place in Alaska during 1990–2006, one-third (311) occurred to fishermen. This is equivalent to an estimated annual [[fatality rate]] of 128/100,000 workers/year. This fatality rate is 26 times that of the overall U.S. work-related fatality rate of approximately 5/100,000 workers/year for the same time period.<ref name=NIOSH>{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/fishing/default.html |title=NIOSH Commercial Fishing in Alaska |access-date=2007-10-13|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref>\n\nWhile the work-related fatality rate for commercial fishers in Alaska is still very high, it does appear to be decreasing: since 1990, there has been a 51 percent decline in the annual fatality rate. The successes in commercial fishing are due in part to the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] implementing new safety requirements in the early 1990s. These safety requirements contributed to 96 percent of the commercial fishers surviving vessel sinkings/capsizings in 2004, whereas in 1991, only 73 percent survived. While the number of occupational deaths in commercial fishers in Alaska has been reduced, there is a continuing pattern of losing 20 to 40 vessels every year. There are still about 100 fishers who must be rescued each year from cold Alaska waters. Successful rescue is still dependent on the expertly trained personnel of the US Coast Guard [[Search and Rescue]] operations, and such efforts can be hindered by the harshness of seas and the weather. Furthermore, the people involved in Search and Rescue operations are themselves at considerable risk for injury or death during these rescue attempts.<ref name=NIOSH/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=260 mode=packed>\nFile:Fisherman and his catch Seychelles.jpg|A fisherman and his catch, including small sharks, hooked on hand lines miles offshore in the [[Seychelles]]\nFile:TraditionalFisherman1Ice.JPG|Traditional Icelandic fisherman\nFile:Shrimpers on horseback.jpg|Belgium shrimpers on horseback\nFile:Banks shrimper.jpg|English shrimper with [[pushnet]]\nFile:Isla Juan Fernandez- Langostas (Lobsters).jpg|Chilean fishermen with [[lobsters]]\n\nFile:Fishing trawlers(Malpe).JPG|Indian fisherman\nFile:Long Island fisherman.jpg|[[Long Island]] fisherman\nFile:Woman_fishing_in_Don_Det,_Laos.jpg|Woman fishing in Laos\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fishing]]\n*[[Recreational fishing]]\n*[[Aquaculture]]\n*[[Fish farming]]\n*[[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning]] \n*[[Fishery]]\n* [[List of American fishers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33 em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Leslie Leyland Fields|Fields, Leslie Leyland]] (editor) (2002) \'\'Out On The Deep Blue: Women, Men, and the Oceans They Fish.\'\' St. Martin\'s Press. {{ISBN|978-0-312-27726-0}}\n* Jones, Stephen (2001) \'\'Working Thin Waters: Conversations with Captain * Lawrence H.
