Tsunamis and tides both produce waves of water that move inland, but in the case of a tsunami, the inland movement of water may be much greater, giving the impression of an incredibly high and forceful tide. In recent years, the term "tidal wave" has fallen out of favour, especially in the scientific community, because the causes of tsunamis have nothing to do with those of [[tide]]s, which are produced by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun rather than the displacement of water.

The area where the earthquake occurred is where the [[Pacific Ocean]] floor is [[subducting]] (or being pushed downwards) under Alaska.\n\nExamples of tsunamis originating at locations away from convergent boundaries include [[Storegga]] about 8,000 years ago, [[Grand Banks]] in 1929, and [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1998 (Tappin, 2001). The Grand Banks and Papua New Guinea tsunamis came from earthquakes which destabilised sediments, causing them to flow into the ocean and generate a tsunami. They dissipated before travelling transoceanic distances.\n\nThe cause of the Storegga sediment failure is unknown. Possibilities include an overloading of the sediments, an earthquake or a release of gas hydrates (methane etc.).\n\nThe [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] ([[Moment magnitude scale|\'\'M\'\'<sub>w</sub>]] 9.5), [[1964 Alaska earthquake]] (\'\'M\'\'<sub>w</sub> 9.2), [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] (\'\'M\'\'<sub>w</sub> 9.2), and [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake]] (\'\'M\'\'<sub>w</sub>9.0) are recent examples of powerful [[megathrust earthquake]]s that generated tsunamis (known as [[teletsunamis]]) that can cross entire oceans.

These are comparable to seismic tsunamis, but usually with lower energies. Essentially, they are dynamically equivalent to seismic tsunamis, the only differences being 1) that meteotsunamis lack the transoceanic reach of significant seismic tsunamis, and 2) that the force that displaces the water is sustained over some length of time such that meteotsunamis cannot be modelled as having been caused instantaneously. In spite of their lower energies, on shorelines where they can be amplified by resonance, they are sometimes powerful enough to cause localised damage and potential for loss of life. They have been documented in many places, including the Great Lakes, the Aegean Sea, the English Channel, and the Balearic Islands, where they are common enough to have a local name, \'\'rissaga\'\'. In Sicily they are called \'\'marubbio\'\' and in Nagasaki Bay, they are called \'\'abiki\'\'. Some examples of destructive meteotsunamis include 31 March 1979 at Nagasaki and 15 June 2006 at Menorca, the latter causing damage in the tens of millions of euros.<ref name="Monserrat">{{cite journal|last1=Monserrat|first1=S.|last2=Vilibíc|first2=I.|last3=Rabinovich|first3=A.

Even during [[World War II]] consideration of the idea using conventional explosives was explored. Nuclear testing in the [[Pacific Proving Ground]] by the United States seemed to generate poor results.  \'\'Operation Crossroads\'\' fired two {{convert|20|ktTNT|abbr=on}} bombs, one in the air and one underwater, above and below the shallow ({{convert|50|m|abbr=on}}) waters of the [[Bikini Atoll]] lagoon.  Fired about {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} from the nearest island, the waves there were no higher than {{convert|3|–|4|m|abbr=on}} upon reaching the shoreline.  Other underwater tests, mainly \'\'[[Operation Hardtack I|Hardtack I]]/Wahoo\'\' (deep water) and \'\'Hardtack I/Umbrella\'\' (shallow water) confirmed the results.  Analysis of the effects of [[underwater explosions#shallow underwater explosions|shallow]] and [[underwater explosions#deep underwater explosions|deep underwater explosions]] indicate that the energy of the explosions does not easily generate the kind of deep, all-ocean waveforms which are tsunamis; most of the energy creates steam, causes vertical fountains above the water, and creates compressional waveforms.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Glasstone| first1=Samuel| last2=Dolan| first2=Philip| date=1977| title=Shock effects of surface and subsurface bursts – The effects of nuclear weapons| edition=third| place=Washington, DC| publisher=U.S. Department of Defense; Energy Research and Development Administration}}</ref> Tsunamis are hallmarked by permanent large vertical displacements of very large volumes of water which do not occur in explosions.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File: Propagation du tsunami en profondeur variable.gif|thumb|When the wave enters shallow water, it slows down and its amplitude (height) increases.]]\n[[File:Tsunami2.JPG|thumb|The wave further slows and amplifies as it hits land. Only the largest waves crest.]]\n\nTsunamis are caused by earthquakes, landslides, volcanic explosions, glacier calvings, and [[bolide]]s. They cause damage by two mechanisms: the smashing force of a wall of water travelling at high speed, and the destructive power of a large volume of water draining off the land and carrying a large amount of debris with it, even with waves that do not appear to be large.\n\nWhile everyday [[wind wave]]s have a [[wavelength]] (from crest to crest) of about {{convert|100|m|ft}} and a height of roughly {{convert|2|m|ft}}, a tsunami in the deep ocean has a much larger wavelength of up to {{convert|200|km|mi}}. Such a wave travels at well over {{convert|800|km/h|mph}}, but owing to the enormous wavelength the wave oscillation at any given point takes 20 or 30 minutes to complete a cycle and has an amplitude of only about {{convert|1|m|ft}}.<ref>[http://earthsci.org/education/teacher/basicgeol/tsumami/tsunami.html Earthsci.org], Tsunamis</ref> This makes tsunamis difficult to detect over deep water, where ships are unable to feel their passage.\n\nThe velocity of a tsunami can be calculated by obtaining the square root of the depth of the water in metres multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (approximated to 10&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>). For example, if the Pacific Ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 metres, the velocity of a tsunami would be {{sqrt|5000 × 10}} = {{sqrt|50000}} ≈ {{convert|224|m/s|ft/s}}, which equates to a speed of about {{convert|806|km/h|mi/h}}. This is the formula used for calculating the velocity of [[Shallow water equations#Wave modelling by shallow water equations|shallow-water]] waves. Even the deep ocean is shallow in this sense because a tsunami wave is so long (horizontally from crest to crest) by comparison.\n\nThe reason for the Japanese name "harbour wave" is that sometimes a village\'s [[fishermen]] would sail out, and encounter no unusual waves while out at sea fishing, and come back to land to find their village devastated by a huge wave.\n\nAs the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow, [[wave shoaling]] compresses the wave and its speed decreases below {{convert|80|km/h|mph}}. Its wavelength diminishes to less than {{convert|20|km|mi}} and its amplitude grows enormously—in accord with [[Green\'s law]]. Since the wave still has the same very long [[frequency|period]], the tsunami may take minutes to reach full height. Except for the very largest tsunamis, the approaching wave does not [[Breaking wave|break]], but rather appears like a fast-moving [[tidal bore]].<ref name="Walrus">{{cite web|url=http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/tsunami/basics.html|title=Life of a Tsunami|date=22 October 2008|work=Western Coastal & Marine Geology|publisher=United States Geographical Survey|access-date=2009-09-09}}</ref> Open bays and coastlines adjacent to very deep water may shape the tsunami further into a step-like wave with a steep-breaking front.\n\nWhen the tsunami\'s wave peak reaches the shore, the resulting temporary rise in sea level is termed \'\'run up\'\'.

However, tsunami interactions with shorelines and the seafloor topography are extremely complex, which leaves some countries more vulnerable than others. For example, the Pacific coasts of the United States and Mexico lie adjacent to each other, but the United States has recorded ten tsunamis in the region since 1788, while Mexico has recorded twenty-five since 1732.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worlddata.info/america/usa/tsunamis.php |website=WorldData|title=Tsunamis in the United States }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worlddata.info/america/mexico/tsunamis.php |website=WorldData|title=Tsunamis in Mexico }}</ref> Similarly, Japan has had more than a hundred tsunamis in recorded history, while the neighboring island of Taiwan has registered only two, in 1781 and 1867.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddata.info/asia/japan/tsunamis.php|title=Tsunamis in Japan|website=Worlddata.info}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddata.info/asia/taiwan/tsunamis.php|title=Tsunamis in Taiwan|website=Worlddata.info}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Drawback==\n[[File: Shallow water wave.gif|upright=2|thumb|right|An illustration of the rhythmic "drawback" of surface water associated with a wave.  It follows that a very large drawback may herald the arrival of a very large wave.]]\n\nAll [[wave]]s have a positive and negative peak; that is, a ridge and a trough.  In the case of a propagating wave like a tsunami, either may be the first to arrive.  If the first part to arrive at the shore is the ridge, a massive breaking wave or sudden flooding will be the first effect noticed on land.  However, if the first part to arrive is a trough, a drawback will occur as the shoreline recedes dramatically, exposing normally submerged areas.  The drawback can exceed hundreds of metres, and people unaware of the danger sometimes remain near the shore to satisfy their curiosity or to collect fish from the exposed seabed.\n\nA typical wave period for a damaging tsunami is about twelve minutes. Thus, the sea recedes in the drawback phase, with areas well below sea level exposed after three minutes.  For the next six minutes, the wave trough builds into a ridge which may flood the coast, and destruction ensues.  During the next six minutes, the wave changes from a ridge to a trough, and the flood waters recede in a second drawback.  Victims and debris may be swept into the ocean.  The process repeats with succeeding waves.\n\n==Scales of intensity and magnitude==\nAs with earthquakes, several attempts have been made to set up scales of tsunami intensity or magnitude to allow comparison between different events.<ref name=Gusiakov>{{cite web|author=Gusiakov V.|title=Tsunami Quantification: how we measure the overall size of tsunami (Review of tsunami intensity and magnitude scales)|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/data/presentations/jtc/gusiakov.pdf|access-date=2009-10-18}}</ref>\n\n===Intensity scales===\nThe first scales used routinely to measure the intensity of tsunamis were the \'\'[[August Heinrich Sieberg|Sieberg]]-[[Nicholas Ambraseys|Ambraseys]] scale\'\' (1962), used in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the \'\'Imamura-Iida intensity scale\'\' (1963), used in the Pacific Ocean. The latter scale was modified by Soloviev (1972), who calculated the tsunami intensity "\'\'I\'\'" according to the formula:\n\n:<math>\\mathit{I} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\log_{2} \\mathit{H}_{av}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathit{H}_{av}</math> is the "tsunami height," averaged along the nearest coastline, with the tsunami height defined as the rise of the water level above the normal tidal level at the time of occurrence of the tsunami.<ref>Soloviev, S., & Go, N., 1974 (English transl. 1984), [http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/69881.pdf “Catalogue of tsunamis on the western shore of the Pacific Ocean”], Canadian Translation of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, No. 5077, (310 p).</ref> This scale, known as the \'\'Soloviev-Imamura tsunami intensity scale\'\', is used in the global tsunami catalogues compiled by the NGDC/NOAA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/tsu_db.shtml|title=NGDC/WDS Global Historical Tsunami Database – NCEI|first=National Geophysical Data|last=Center|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref> and the Novosibirsk Tsunami Laboratory as the main parameter for the size of the tsunami.\n\nThis formula yields:\n* \'\'I\'\' = 2 for <math>\\mathit{H}_{av}</math> = 2.8 metres\n* \'\'I\'\' = 3 for <math>\\mathit{H}_{av}</math> = 5.5 metres\n* \'\'I\'\' = 4 for <math>\\mathit{H}_{av}</math> = 11 metres\n* \'\'I\'\' = 5 for <math>\\mathit{H}_{av}</math> = 22.5 metres\n* etc.\n\nIn 2013, following the intensively studied tsunamis in 2004 and 2011, a new 12-point scale was proposed, the Integrated Tsunami Intensity Scale (ITIS-2012), intended to match as closely as possible to the modified [[Environmental Seismic Intensity scale|ESI2007]] and [[European Macroseismic Scale|EMS]] earthquake intensity scales.<ref name="Lekkas et al 2013">{{cite journal | title=A Proposal for a New Integrated Tsunami Intensity Scale (ITIS‐2012) | author=Lekkas E. | author2=Andreadakis E. | author3=Kostaki I. | author4=Kapourani E. | name-list-style=amp | journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America | date=2013 | volume=103 | issue=2B | pages=1493–1502 | doi=10.1785/0120120099|bibcode = 2013BuSSA.103.1493L }}</ref><ref>Katsetsiadou, K.N., Andreadakis, E. and Lekkas, E., 2016.

People who observe drawback (many survivors report an accompanying sucking sound), can survive only if they immediately run for high ground or seek the upper floors of nearby buildings.\n\nIn 2004, ten-year-old [[Tilly Smith]] of [[Surrey]], England, was on [[Maikhao beach]] in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], Thailand with her parents and sister, and having learned about tsunamis recently in school, told her family that a tsunami might be imminent. Her parents warned others minutes before the wave arrived, saving dozens of lives. She credited her geography teacher, Andrew Kearney.\n\nIn the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] drawback was not reported on the African coast or any other east-facing coasts that it reached. This was because the initial wave moved downwards on the eastern side of the megathrust and upwards on the western side. The western pulse hit coastal Africa and other western areas.\n\nA tsunami cannot be precisely predicted, even if the magnitude and location of an earthquake is known. [[Geologist]]s, [[oceanographer]]s, and [[seismologist]]s analyse each earthquake and based on many factors may or may not issue a tsunami warning. However, there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami, and automated systems can provide warnings immediately after an earthquake in time to save lives. One of the most successful systems uses bottom pressure sensors, attached to buoys, which constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column.\n\nRegions with a high tsunami risk typically use [[tsunami warning system]]s to warn the population before the wave reaches land. On the west coast of the United States, which is prone to tsunamis from the Pacific Ocean, warning signs indicate evacuation routes. In Japan, the populace is well-educated about earthquakes and tsunamis, and along Japanese shorelines, tsunami warning signs remind people of the natural hazards along with a network of warning sirens, typically at the top of the cliffs of surrounding hills.<ref name="Chanson_2010">{{cite journal|author=Chanson, H.|author-link=Hubert Chanson |title= Tsunami Warning Signs on the Enshu Coast of Japan  |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203103 |journal=Shore & Beach|pages=52–54|number=1|volume=78 |date=2010 |issn= 0037-4237}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center|Pacific Tsunami Warning System]] is based in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]]. It monitors Pacific Ocean seismic activity. A sufficiently large earthquake magnitude and other information triggers a tsunami warning. While the subduction zones around the Pacific are seismically active, not all earthquakes generate a tsunami. Computers assist in analysing the tsunami risk of every earthquake that occurs in the Pacific Ocean and the adjoining land masses.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bamfield Tsunami Hazard Zone sign.jpg|Tsunami hazard sign at [[Bamfield]], [[British Columbia]]\nFile: A tsunami warning sign in Kamakura, Japan.jpg|A tsunami warning sign in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], Japan\nFile:Zona de Inundabilidad.jpg|A Tsunami hazard sign (Spanish - English) in [[Iquique]], [[Chile]].\nFile:Tsunami Evacuation Route signage south of Aberdeen Washington.jpg|alt=Photo of evacuation sign|Tsunami Evacuation Route signage along [[U.S. Route 101 in Washington|U.S. Route 101]], in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]\n</gallery>\n\nAs a direct result of the Indian Ocean tsunami, a re-appraisal of the tsunami threat for all coastal areas is being undertaken by national governments and the United Nations Disaster Mitigation Committee. A tsunami warning system is being installed in the Indian Ocean.\n\n[[File:Dart tsunamicover.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the deep water [[buoy]]s used in the [[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis|DART]] tsunami warning system]]\n\n[[Computer model]]s can predict tsunami arrival, usually within minutes of the arrival time. Bottom pressure sensors can relay information in [[present|real time]]. Based on these pressure readings and other seismic information and the seafloor\'s shape ([[bathymetry]]) and coastal [[topography]], the models estimate the amplitude and surge height of the approaching tsunami. All [[Pacific Rim]] countries collaborate in the Tsunami Warning System and most regularly practise evacuation and other procedures. In Japan, such preparation is mandatory for government, local authorities, emergency services and the population.\n\nAlong the United States west coast, in addition to sirens, warnings are sent on television and radio via the [[National Weather Service]], using the [[Emergency Alert System]].\n\n===Possible animal reaction===\n{{further|Infrasound#Animal reaction}}\nSome zoologists hypothesise that some animal species have an ability to sense subsonic [[Rayleigh waves]] from an earthquake or a tsunami. If correct, monitoring their behaviour could provide advance warning of earthquakes and tsunamis. However, the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted. There are unsubstantiated claims about the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Lisbon quake]] that some animals escaped to higher ground, while many other animals in the same areas drowned. The phenomenon was also noted by media sources in [[Sri Lanka]] in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=2005-03-27|first=Helen|last=Lambourne|title=Tsunami: Anatomy of a disaster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4269847.stm}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Surviving the Tsunami: What Sri Lanka\'s animals knew that humans didn\'t|first=Christine|last=Kenneally|magazine=Slate Magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2111608|date=2004-12-30}}</ref> It is possible that certain animals (e.g., [[elephant]]s) may have heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants\' reaction was to move away from the approaching noise. By contrast, some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.\n\n==Mitigation==\n{{see also|Seawall}}\n\n[[File:Tsunami wall.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[seawall]] at [[Tsu, Mie|Tsu]], [[Mie Prefecture]] in Japan|alt=Photo of seawall, with building in background]]\n\nIn some tsunami-prone countries, [[earthquake engineering]] measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused onshore.\n\n[[Japan]], where tsunami science and response measures first began following a [[1896 Sanriku earthquake|disaster in 1896]], has produced ever-more elaborate countermeasures and response plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/tsunami-japan/ |title=Journalist\'s Resource: Research for Reporting, from Harvard Shorenstein Center |publisher=Content.hks.harvard.edu |date=2012-05-30 |access-date=2012-06-12}}</ref> The country has built many tsunami walls of up to {{convert|12|m|ft}} high to protect populated coastal areas. Other localities have built [[floodgate]]s of up to {{convert|15.5|m|ft}} high and channels to redirect the water from an incoming tsunami.  However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as tsunamis often overtop the barriers.\n\nThe [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] was directly triggered by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], when waves exceeded the height of the plant\'s sea wall.<ref name=":18">Phillip Lipscy, Kenji Kushida, and Trevor Incerti. 2013.
