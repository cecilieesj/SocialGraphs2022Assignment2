During his teens, he made many appearances in recital as an orchestral soloist in Uruguay, [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]].  He made his debut with the Uruguayan Symphony [[Orchestra]] ([[SODRE]]) at thirteen.  In 1966, as a recipient of a full scholarship from the [[Organization of American States]], Reyes went to the [[United States]] to study at the [[Indiana University School of Music]] with American pianist, Sidney Foster, the first Leventritt Award winner and a pupil of [[David Saperton]] at the Curtis Institute of Music.<ref name=Carnegie/>\n\nIn 1971, as a [[laureate]] of the Leventritt Competition in the United States, Reyes made his first [[North America]]n tour.  The following year, he became the first Uruguayan pianist to tour the former [[Soviet Union]] as laureate of the 1970 [[International Tchaikovsky Competition|Tchaikovsky Competition]].  Reyes made his [[New York City]] [[orchestral]] debut in 1974 at the [[Avery Fisher Hall]] in [[Lincoln Center]], and his New York recital debut at the [[92nd Street Y]], presented by the America\'s Society.<ref name=Carnegie/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/03/arts/review-piano-uruguay-s-alberto-reyes.html Kozinn, Allan.
