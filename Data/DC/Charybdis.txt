She, with the sea monster [[Scylla]], appears as a challenge to epic characters such as [[Odysseus]], [[Jason]], and [[Aeneas]]. Scholarship locates her in the [[Strait of Messina]].\n\nThe idiom "[[between Scylla and Charybdis]]" has come to mean being forced to choose between two similarly dangerous situations.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Strait of Messina.jpg|thumb|320px|The Strait of Messina, with Scylla (underlined in red) and Charybdis on the opposite shores]]\nThe sea monster Charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel. Opposite her was [[Scylla]], another sea monster, that lived inside a much larger rock.<ref>[[Homer]], \'\'[[Odyssey]]\'\' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0136:book=12:card=73&highlight=charybdis 12.104]</ref> The sides of the strait were within an arrow-shot of each other, and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other. To be "[[between Scylla and Charybdis]]" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both. Three times a day, Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water, before belching it back out again, creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater. In some variations of the story, Charybdis was simply a large [[whirlpool]] instead of a sea monster.\n\nThrough the descriptions of Greek mythical chroniclers and Greek historians such as [[Thucydides]], modern scholars generally agree that Charybdis was said to have been located in the [[Strait of Messina]], off the [[coast]] of [[Sicily]] and opposite a rock on the mainland identified with Scylla.<ref>[[Thucydides]], \'\'[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]\'\' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=thuc.%204.24 4.24.5]</ref>  A whirlpool does exist there, caused by currents meeting, but it is dangerous only to small craft in extreme conditions.<ref>Andrews, Tamra (2000). \'\'Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky\'\'.

Zeus, angry over the land she stole from him, captured and chained her to the sea-bed. Charybdis was then cursed by the god and transformed into a hideous bladder of a monster, with flippers for arms and legs, and an uncontrollable thirst for the sea. As such, she drank the water from the sea thrice a day to quench it, which created whirlpools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Charybdis/charybdis.html|title=Charybdis|website=www.greekmythology.com|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Kharybdis.html|title=Charybdis (Kharybdis) – Whirlpool Monster of Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref> She lingered on a rock with Scylla facing her directly on another rock, making a strait.\n\nIn some myths, Charybdis was a voracious woman who stole oxen from [[Heracles]], and was hurled by the thunderbolt of Zeus into the sea, where she retained her voracious nature.<ref name=":0" />\n\n===The \'\'Odyssey\'\'===\n[[File:Scylla and Charybdis.jpg|thumb|left|A 19th-century engraving of the Strait of Messina, the site associated with Scylla and Charybdis]] [[Odysseus]] faced both Charybdis and Scylla while rowing through a narrow channel. He ordered his men to avoid Charybdis, thus forcing them to pass near Scylla, which resulted in the deaths of six of his men. Later, stranded on a raft, Odysseus was swept back through the strait and passed near Charybdis. His raft was sucked into her maw, but he survived by clinging to a fig tree growing on a rock over her lair. On the next outflow of water, when his raft was expelled, Odysseus recovered it and paddled away safely.<ref>Homer, \'\'Odyssey\'\' 12.[http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey12.htm#_Toc90268048 201–59 & 430–50]</ref>\n\n===Jason and the Argonauts===\nThe [[Argonauts]] were able to avoid both dangers because [[Hera]] ordered the [[Nereid]] [[nymph]] [[Thetis]], [[Achilles]]\' mother, to guide them through the perilous passage.<ref>[[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]], \'\'[[Argonautica]]\'\' 4.821–960</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===The \'\'Aeneid\'\'===\nIn the \'\'[[Aeneid]]\'\' the Trojans are warned by [[Helenus]] of Scylla and Charybdis, and are advised to avoid them by sailing around Pachynus point ([[Cape Passero]]) rather than risk [[Strait of Messina|the strait]].<ref>Gutenberg Project: \'\'The Aeneid\'\' E.
