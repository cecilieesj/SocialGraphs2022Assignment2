Her screen image was that of a seductress, dressed in fanciful costumes and sparkling jewels. She became so identified with these adventure epics that she became known as \'\'\'The Queen of Technicolor\'\'\'. Over her career, Montez appeared in 26 films, 21 of which were made in North America, with the last five being made in Europe.\n\n==Early life==\nMontez was born \'\'\'María Antonia Gracia Vidal de Santo Silas\'\'\' (some sources cite \'\'\'María África Gracia Vidal\'\'\' or \'\'\'María África Antonia Gracia Vidal de Santo Silas\'\'\' as her birth name) in [[Barahona (city)|Barahona]], [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hadley-García|first=George|title=Hispanic Hollywood: The Latins in Motion Pictures|year=1991|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|isbn=0-806-51185-0|page=114}}</ref>  She was one of ten children born to Isidoro Gracia García, a Spaniard, and Teresa Vidal, a Dominican of [[Criollo people|Criollo]] descent. Montez was educated at the Sacred Heart Convent in [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], Spain. In the mid-1930s, her father was appointed to the Spanish consulship in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] where the family moved. It was there that Montez met her first husband, William G. McFeeters, whom she married at age 17.<ref name=silverscreen>{{cite web|title=The Life and Times of Maria Montez|url=http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show.php?id=195|publisher=glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com}}</ref>\nIn the book, \'\'Maria Montez, Su Vida\'\'<ref>Margarita Vicens de Morales: [http://www.mariamontez.org/mmsuvidaeng.html María Montez, Su Vida]</ref> by Margarita Vicens de Morales, there is a copy of Montez\'s birth certificate proving that her original name was María África Gracia Vidal. Her father\'s name was Isidoro Gracia (not Garcia) and her mother\'s name was Teresa Vidal. There is also a copy of a fake biography made by Universal Pictures, where it says that Montez was educated in Tenerife and that she lived in Ireland, which was never true. Instead, it claims that Montez lived the first 27 years of her life in the Dominican Republic.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Maria Montez cropped.JPG|thumb|From the trailer of the film \'\'Cobra Woman\'\' (1944)]]\nMontez was spotted by a talent scout while visiting New York.

This was the first film where she played a leading role and the only role where she speaks some Spanish.\n\nHer next film role was in \'\'[[The Invisible Woman (1940 film)|The Invisible Woman]]\'\' (1940).

In the words of \'\'The Los Angeles Times\'\' "she borrowed an old but sure-fire technique to get ahead in the movies. She acted like a movie star.

Hall, Montez, and Bey were meant to reunite in \'\'Gypsy Wildcat\'\' (1944), but Bey was required on another film and ended up being replaced by Peter Coe. \'\'Sudan\'\' (1945) starred Montez, Hall, and Bey, with Bey as Montez\'s romantic interest this time.\n\n\'\'Flame of Stamboul\'\' was another proposed Hall-Bey-Montez film but it was postponed.<ref>{{cite news|title=DRAMA AND FILM: Helen Walker Awarded Starring Opportunity Maria Montez, Hall and Turhan Bey Will Appear in \'Flame of Stamboul\'|last=Scheuer|first= Philip K. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=11 September 1943|page= 7}}</ref> Universal also announced that Montez would play [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elisabeth of Austria]] in \'\'The Golden Fleece\'\', based on a story by Bertita Harding, but it was never made.<ref>{{cite news|title=Likely to Pay Empress Role R.K.O.
