Genealogically speaking, Shango is a royal ancestor of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] as he was the third [[Alaafin]] of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo Kingdom]] prior to his posthumous [[deification]]. Shango has numerous manifestations, including Airá, Agodo, Afonja, Lubé, and Obomin.<ref name="a"/><ref name="William"/> He is known for his powerful double axe (\'\'\'Oṣè\'\'\'). He is considered to be one of the most powerful rulers that [[Yorubaland]] has ever produced.\n\nIn the [[New World]], he is syncretized with either [[Saint Barbara]] or [[Saint Jerome]].\n\n==Historical figure==\n\nṢàngó was the third Alafin of Oyo, following [[Oranmiyan]] and [[Ajaka]].<ref name="William" /> He brought prosperity to the [[Oyo Empire]].<ref name="Anthony" /> According to Professor Mason\'s \'\'Mythological Account of Heroes and Kings\'\', unlike his peaceful brother Ajaka, he was a powerful and violent ruler. He reigned for seven years which were marked by his continuous campaigns and many battles. His reign ended due to his inadvertent destruction of his palace by lightning. He had three wives, namely Queen [[Oshun]], Queen [[Oba (orisha)|Oba]], and Queen [[Oya]]. The Oyo Empire fell into civil war in the 19th century. It lost Ilorin when the Fulani and Hausa soldiers of [[Afonja]] led a successful revolt.\n\nSome of the slaves brought to the Americas were Yoruba, one of the various ethnic groups drawn into the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic Slave trade]], and they brought the worship of Ṣàngó to the New World as a result. Strong devotion to Ṣàngó led to Yoruba religions in Trinidad and [[Recife]], Brazil being named after the deity.<ref name="v" />\n\nIn Yorubaland, Ṣàngó is worshiped on the fifth day of the week, which is named Ojo Jakuta. Ritual worship foods include guguru, bitter cola, [[Amala (food)|àmàlà]], and gbegiri soup. Also, he is worshiped with the Bata drum. One significant thing about this deity is that he is worshiped using red clothing, just as he is said to have admired red attire during his lifetime.<ref name="j"/>\n\n==Veneration of Ṣàngó==\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n\nṢàngó is viewed as the most powerful and feared of the orisha pantheon. He casts a "thunderstone" to earth, which creates thunder and lightning, to anyone who offends him. Worshippers in [[Yorubaland]] in [[Nigeria]] do not eat [[cowpea]] because they believe that the wrath of the god of iron would descend on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mp3indir.icu/sango-spit-fire-in-oyo-world-sango-festival-2016-mp3-indir_IEhWngH8OfU.html|title=Sango spit fire in Oyo @ World Sango Festival 2016 Mp3 İndir|website=mp3indir.icu|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref> The Ṣàngó god necklaces are composed in varying patterns of red and white beads; usually in groupings of four or six which are his sacred numbers. Rocks created by lightning strikes are venerated by Ṣàngó worshipers; these stones, if found, are maintained at sacred sites and used in rituals. Ṣàngó is called on during coronation ceremonies in Nigeria to the present day.<ref name="mu"/><ref name="Onifade"/><ref name="v"/>\n\n=== The Americas ===\n\nṢàngó is venerated in [[Santería]] as "Changó". As in the Yoruba religion, Changó is the most feared god in Santería.<ref name="mu"/>\n\nIn Haïti, he is from the "Nago"  Nation, and is known as Ogou Chango. [[Palo (religion)|Palo]] recognizes him as "Siete Rayos".\n\n====Candomblé====\n\nṢàngó is known as Xangô in the [[Candomblé]] pantheon. He is said to be the son of [[Oranyan]], and his wives include [[Oya]], [[Oshun]], and [[Oba (Orisha)|Oba]], as in the Yoruba tradition. Xangô took on strong importance among slaves in Brazil for his qualities of strength, resistance, and aggression. He is noted as the god of lightning and thunder. He became the patron [[Orisha|orixa]] of plantations and many Candomblé terreiros. In contrast [[Oko (Orisha)|Oko]], the orixá of agriculture, found little favor among slaves in Brazil and has few followers in the Americas. The main barracão of [[Ilê Axé Iyá Nassô Oká]], or the terreiro Casa Branca, is dedicated to Xangô. Xangô is depicted with an \'\'oxê\'\', or double-sided ax similar to a [[labrys]]; and a brass crown.<ref name="l"/><ref name="v"/><ref name="abril"/>\n\n====Characteristics====\n\n*Consecrated day: Friday \n*Colors: white and red\n*Elements: thunder, lightning, fire\n*Sacred food: amalá (a stew of okra with shrimp and [[palm oil]])\n*Instruments: oxê, a double ax; bangles; brass crown; Thunder Stones, or objects struck by lightning \n*Garment: red cloth with printed white squares or cowrie shells\n*Necklace or Elekes: white and red beads\n*Archetype: power, dominance\n*Sacred dance: \'\'alujá\'\', the \'\'roda de Xangô\'\'.

It is a stew made of chopped okra, onion, dried shrimp, and palm oil. Amalá is served on Wednesday at the \'\'pegi\'\', or altar, on a large tray, traditionally decorated with 12 upright uncooked okra. Due to ritual prohibitions, the dish may not be offered on a wooden tray or accompanied by [[garcinia kola|bitter kola]]. Amalá de Xangô may also be prepared with the addition of beef, specifically an ox tail. Amalá de Xangô is different than [[amala (food)|àmàlà]], a dish common to Yoruba areas of Nigeria.<ref name="l"/>\n\n==Popular culture==\n\n* "Shango (Chant to the God of Thunder)" is a track from \'\'[[Drums of Passion]]\'\', an album released by [[Nigeria|Nigerian]] [[Percussion|percussionist]] [[Babatunde Olatunji]] in 1960.\n*"Shango" is the title of a [[Hugh Masekela]] track on his 2016 album \'\'[[No Borders]]\'\'.\n* The song "Que Viva Chango" by [[Celina González|Celina y Reutilio]] refers both to Chango and to Santa Barbara.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0_0frqtOok&list=RDK0_0frqtOok&start_radio=1%3C%2Fref%3E%3Cref%3Ehttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.paroles-musique.com%2Feng%2FCelina_feat_Reutilio-Que_Viva_Chango-lyrics%2Cp036582493%3C%2Fref|title = - YouTube|website = [[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paroles-musique.com/eng/Celina_feat_Reutilio-Que_Viva_Chango-lyrics,p036582493|title=Que Viva Chango lyrics by Celina & Reutilio}}</ref>\n* Shango is a large theme in the [[Mighty Sparrow]] song "Congo Man".\n* Caliban invokes Shango in [[Aimé Césaire]]\'s play \'\'[[Une Tempête]]\'\' (\'\'A Tempest\'\').<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.aspresolver.com/aspresolver.asp?BLD2;PL005436|title=A tempest|last=Césaire|first=Aimé|date=2010|publisher=[[Alexander Street Press]]|location=Alexandria, VA|language=en}}</ref>\n* Shango appears as a minor character in \'\'[[The Iron Druid Chronicles]]\'\' by [[Kevin Hearne]].\n* In episode 28 of the telenovela \'\'[[Celia (2015 TV series)|Celia]]\'\', loosely based on the life of [[Celia Cruz]] (produced by Telemundo), the cultural ancestors of Celia\'s African heritage visit her in her dreams, chanting and invoking the presence of Chango.\n* "Shango" is a bonus track on [[Guadalcanal Diary (band)|Guadalcanal Diary]]\'s album \'\'[[2×4 (Guadalcanal Diary album)|2x4]]\'\'.\n* Chango is portrayed by [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]] in season 3 of \'\'[[American Gods (TV series)|American Gods]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.looper.com/323792/why-chango-from-american-gods-season-3-looks-so-familiar/|title=Why Chango From American Gods Season 3 Looks So Familiar|work=Looper.com |author=Abbey White|date=2021-01-31 |access-date=2021-02-01}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Legends of Africa]]\n{{portal|Traditional African religion}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name="a">{{cite book | last = Adeoye | first = C.
