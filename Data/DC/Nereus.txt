He was never more manifestly the Old Man of the Sea than when he was described, like [[Proteus]], as a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] with the power of prophecy, who would aid heroes such as [[Heracles]]<ref>Or, as [[Proteus]], [[Menelaus]].</ref> who managed to catch him even as he changed shapes. Nereus and [[Proteus]] (the "first") seem to be two manifestations of the god of the sea who was supplanted by [[Poseidon]] when [[Zeus]] overthrew [[Cronus]].\n\nThe earliest poet to link Nereus with the [[Twelve Labors of Heracles|labours of Heracles]] was [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherekydes]], according to a \'\'[[scholia|scholion]]\'\' on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]].<ref>\'\'On Argonautica\'\' iv.1396f, noted by Ruth Glynn, "Herakles, Nereus and Triton: A Study of Iconography in Sixth Century Athens", \'\'American Journal of Archaeology\'\' \'\'\'85\'\'\'.2 (April 1981, pp. 121–132) p 121f.</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the 5th century BC, Nereus was gradually replaced by [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], who does not appear in Homer, in the imagery of the struggle between Heracles and the sea-god who had to be restrained in order to deliver his information that was employed by the vase-painters, independent of any literary testimony.<ref>Glynn 1981:121–132.</ref>\n\nIn a late appearance, according to a fragmentary [[papyrus]], [[Alexander the Great]] paused at the Syrian seashore before the climacteric [[battle of Issus]] (333 BC), and resorted to prayers, "calling on [[Thetis]], Nereus and the Nereids, nymphs of the sea, and invoking [[Poseidon]] the sea-god, for whom he ordered a [[Quadriga|four-horse chariot]] to be cast into the waves."<ref>[[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Müller]]\'s ed.
